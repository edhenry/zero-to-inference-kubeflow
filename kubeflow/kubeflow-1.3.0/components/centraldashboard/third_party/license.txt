      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

# gRPC on Node.js
## Implementations
For a comparison of the features available in these two libraries, see [this document](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/tree/master/PACKAGE-COMPARISON.md)
### C-based Client and Server
Directory: [`packages/grpc-native-core`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/tree/master/packages/grpc-native-core) (see here for installation information)
npm package: [grpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grpc).
This is the existing, feature-rich implementation of gRPC using a C++ addon. It works on all LTS versions of Node.js on most platforms that Node.js runs on.
### Pure JavaScript Client
Directory: [`packages/grpc-js`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/tree/master/packages/grpc-js)
npm package: [@grpc/grpc-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grpc/grpc-js)
**This library is currently incomplete and experimental. It is built on the [http2 Node module](https://nodejs.org/api/http2.html).**
This library implements the core functionality of gRPC purely in JavaScript, without a C++ addon. It works on the latest version of Node.js on all platforms that Node.js runs on.
## Other Packages
### gRPC Protobuf Loader
Directory: [`packages/proto-loader`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/tree/master/packages/proto-loader)
npm package: [@grpc/proto-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grpc/proto-loader)
This library loads `.proto` files into objects that can be passed to the gRPC libraries.
### gRPC Tools
Directory: [`packages/grpc-tools`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/tree/master/packages/grpc-tools)
npm package: [grpc-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grpc-tools)
Distribution of protoc and the gRPC Node protoc plugin for ease of installation with npm.
### gRPC Health Check Service
Directory: [`packages/grpc-health-check`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/tree/master/packages/grpc-health-check)
npm package: [grpc-health-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grpc-health-check)
Health check service for gRPC servers.

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A collection of elements, along with guidelines and templates that can be used to structure your app’s layout.
## What is inside
### Elements
- [app-box](https://github.com/PolymerElements/app-layout/tree/master/app-box) - A container element that can have scroll effects - visual effects based on scroll position.
- [app-drawer](https://github.com/PolymerElements/app-layout/tree/master/app-drawer) - A navigation drawer that can slide in from the left or right.
- [app-drawer-layout](https://github.com/PolymerElements/app-layout/tree/master/app-drawer-layout) - A wrapper element that positions an app-drawer and other content.
- [app-grid](https://github.com/PolymerElements/app-layout/tree/master/app-grid) - A helper class useful for creating responsive, fluid grid layouts using custom properties.
- [app-header](https://github.com/PolymerElements/app-layout/tree/master/app-header) - A container element for app-toolbars at the top of the screen that can have scroll effects - visual effects based on scroll position.
- [app-header-layout](https://github.com/PolymerElements/app-layout/tree/master/app-header-layout) - A wrapper element that positions an app-header and other content.
- [app-toolbar](https://github.com/PolymerElements/app-layout/tree/master/app-toolbar) - A horizontal toolbar containing items that can be used for label, navigation, search and actions.
### Templates
The templates are a means to define, illustrate and share best practices in App Layout. Pick a template and customize it:
- **Getting started**
([Demo](https://polymerelements.github.io/app-layout/templates/getting-started) - [Source](/templates/getting-started))
- **Landing page**
([Demo](https://polymerelements.github.io/app-layout/templates/landing-page) - [Source](/templates/landing-page))
- **Publishing: Zuperkülblog**
([Demo](https://polymerelements.github.io/app-layout/templates/publishing) - [Source](/templates/publishing))
- **Shop: Shrine**
([Demo](https://polymerelements.github.io/app-layout/templates/shrine) - [Source](/templates/shrine))
- **Blog: Pesto**
([Demo](https://polymerelements.github.io/app-layout/templates/pesto) - [Source](/templates/pesto))
- **Scroll effects: Test drive**
([Demo](https://polymerelements.github.io/app-layout/templates/test-drive) - [Source](/templates/test-drive))
### Patterns
Sample code for various UI patterns:
- **Transform navigation:**
As more screen space is available, side navigation can transform into tabs.
([Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-layout/demo/patterns/transform-navigation/index.html) - [Source](/patterns/transform-navigation/x-app.html))
- **Expand Card:**
Content cards may expand to take up more horizontal space.
([Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-layout/demo/patterns/expand-card/index.html) - [Source](/patterns/expand-card/index.html))
- **Material Design Responsive Toolbar:**
Toolbar changes its height and padding to adapt mobile screen size.
([Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-layout/demo/patterns/md-responsive-toolbar/index.html) - [Source](/patterns/md-responsive-toolbar/index.html))

## IronCheckedElementBehavior
Use `IronCheckedElementBehavior` to implement a custom element that has a
`checked` property, which can be used for validation if the element is also
`required`. Element instances implementing this behavior will also be
registered for use in an `iron-form` element.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-checked-element-behavior),
 [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-checked-element-behavior/demo/demo/index.html).

## &lt;iron-flex-layout&gt;
The `<iron-flex-layout>` component provides simple ways to use
[CSS flexible box layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes),
also known as flexbox. Note that this is an old element, that was written
before all modern browsers had non-prefixed flex styles. As such, nowadays you
don't really need to use this element anymore, and can use CSS flex styles
directly in your code.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-flex-layout),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-flex-layout/demo/demo/index.html).
This component provides two different ways to use flexbox:
1. [Layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).
The layout class stylesheet provides a simple set of class-based flexbox rules, that
let you specify layout properties directly in markup. You must include this file
in every element that needs to use them.
1. [Custom CSS mixins](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/blob/master/iron-flex-layout.html).
The mixin stylesheet includes custom CSS mixins that can be applied inside a CSS rule using the `@apply` function.
## Usage
### Installation
```
npm install --save @polymer/iron-flex-layout
```
### In a Polymer 3 element
```js
import {PolymerElement, html} from '@polymer/polymer';
import '@polymer/iron-flex-layout/iron-flex-layout-classes.js';
class SampleElement extends PolymerElement {
  static get template() {
    return html`
      <style is="custom-style" include="iron-flex iron-flex-alignment"></style>
      <style>
        .test { width: 100px; }
      </style>
      <div class="layout horizontal center-center">
        <div class="test">horizontal layout center alignment</div>

## IronFormElementBehavior
`IronFormElementBehavior` adds a `name`, `value` and `required` properties to
a custom element. This element is deprecated, and only exists for back compatibility
with Polymer 1.x (where `iron-form` was a type extension), and
it is not something you want to use. No contributions or fixes will be accepted.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-form-element-behavior).

### Installation
```
npm install --save @polymer/iron-form-element-behavior

## &lt;iron-iconset-svg&gt;
The `iron-iconset-svg` element allows users to define their own icon sets that
contain svg icons.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-iconset-svg),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-iconset-svg/demo/demo/index.html).
## Usage

### In an HTML file

    </iron-iconset-svg>
    <iron-icon icon="inline:shape" role="img" aria-label="A shape"></iron-icon>
  </body>
</html>
```
### In a Polymer 3 element
You can use an `<iron-iconset-svg>` anywhere you could put a custom element,
such as in the shadow root of another component to expose icons to it. However,
if you're going to be creating many instances of the containing component, you
should move your `<iron-iconset-svg>` out to a separate module. This prevents a
redundant `<iron-iconset-svg>` from being added to the shadow root of each
instance of that component. See the demo (and specifically
`demo/svg-sample-icons.js`) for an example.
```js
import {PolymerElement} from '@polymer/polymer/polymer-element.js';
import {html} from '@polymer/polymer/lib/utils/html-tag.js';
import '@polymer/iron-iconset-svg/iron-iconset-svg.js';
import '@polymer/iron-icon/iron-icon.js';
class ExampleElement extends PolymerElement {
  static get template() {
    return html`
      <iron-iconset-svg name="inline" size="24">
        <svg>
          <defs>
<g id="shape">
  <rect x="12" y="0" width="12" height="24"></rect>
  <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="12"></circle>
</g>
          </defs>
        </svg>
      </iron-iconset-svg>
      <iron-icon icon="inline:shape" role="img" aria-label="A shape"></iron-icon>
    `;
  }

## &lt;iron-image&gt;
`iron-image` is an element for displaying an image that provides useful sizing
and preloading options not found on the standard `<img>` tag.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-image),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-image/demo/demo/index.html).

## &lt;iron-input&gt;
`<iron-input>` adds two-way binding and custom validators using `Polymer.IronValidatorBehavior`
to `<input>`.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-input),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-input/demo/demo/index.html).
## Usage
### Installation
```
npm install --save @polymer/iron-input
```
### In an html file
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="module">
      import '@polymer/iron-input/iron-input.js';
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <iron-input>
      <input>
    </iron-input>
  </body>
</html>
```
### In a Polymer 3 element
```js
import {PolymerElement, html} from '@polymer/polymer';
import '@polymer/iron-input/iron-input.js';
class SampleElement extends PolymerElement {
  static get template() {
    return html`
      <iron-input>
        <input>
      </iron-input>
    `;
  }
}
customElements.define('sample-element', SampleElement);
```
### Two-way binding
By default you can only get notified of changes to an `input`'s `value` due to user input:
```html
<input value="{{myValue::input}}">
```
`iron-input` adds the `bind-value` property that mirrors the `value` property, and can be used
for two-way data binding. `bind-value` will notify if it is changed either by user input or by script.
```html
<iron-input bind-value="{{bindValue}}">
  <input value="{{value::input}}">
</iron-input>
```
### Custom validators
You can use custom validators that implement `Polymer.IronValidatorBehavior` with `<iron-input>`.
```html
<iron-input auto-validate validator="my-custom-validator">
  <input placeholder="only 'cat' is valid">
 </iron-input>
```
### Stopping invalid input
It may be desirable to only allow users to enter certain characters. You can use the
`prevent-invalid-input` and `allowed-pattern` attributes together to accomplish this. This feature
is separate from validation, and `allowed-pattern` does not affect how the input is validated.
```html
<!-- only allow characters that match [0-9] -->
<iron-input allowed-pattern="[0-9]">
  <input pattern="\d{5}">
</iron-input>
```

## &lt;iron-a11y-announcer&gt;
`iron-a11y-announcer` is a singleton element that is intended to add a11y
to features that require on-demand announcement from screen readers. In
order to make use of the announcer, it is best to request its availability
in the announcing element.
Note: announcements are only audible if you have a screen reader enabled.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-a11y-announcer),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-a11y-announcer/demo/demo/index.html)

## Known Issues
This element doesn't work on Firefox (it doesn't read anything in Voice Over), since
`aria-live` has been broken since the Quantum redesign (see the [MDN docs demo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions))
-- we tested it on Firefox 60, but it doesn't look like a regression, so
it's probably broken on older versions as well.

[![Published on NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@polymer/iron-overlay-behavior.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polymer/iron-overlay-behavior)
[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/iron-overlay-behavior.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/iron-overlay-behavior)
[![Published on webcomponents.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/webcomponents.org-published-blue.svg)](https://webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-overlay-behavior)
## IronOverlayBehavior
Use `IronOverlayBehavior` to implement an element that can be hidden or shown, and displays
on top of other content. It includes an optional backdrop, and can be used to implement a variety
of UI controls including dialogs and drop downs. Multiple overlays may be displayed at once.
See the [demo source code](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-overlay-behavior/blob/master/demo/simple-overlay.js)
for an example.
### Closing and canceling
An overlay may be hidden by closing or canceling. The difference between close and cancel is user
intent. Closing generally implies that the user acknowledged the content on the overlay. By default,
it will cancel whenever the user taps outside it or presses the escape key. This behavior is
configurable with the `no-cancel-on-esc-key` and the `no-cancel-on-outside-click` properties.
`close()` should be called explicitly by the implementer when the user interacts with a control
in the overlay element. When the dialog is canceled, the overlay fires an 'iron-overlay-canceled'
event. Call `preventDefault` on this event to prevent the overlay from closing.
### Positioning
By default the element is sized and positioned to fit and centered inside the window. You can
position and size it manually using CSS. See `Polymer.IronFitBehavior`.
### Backdrop
Set the `with-backdrop` attribute to display a backdrop behind the overlay. The backdrop is
appended to `<body>` and is of type `<iron-overlay-backdrop>`. See its doc page for styling
options.
In addition, `with-backdrop` will wrap the focus within the content in the light DOM.
Override the [`_focusableNodes` getter](#Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior:property-_focusableNodes)
to achieve a different behavior.
### Limitations
The element is styled to appear on top of other content by setting its `z-index` property. You
must ensure no element has a stacking context with a higher `z-index` than its parent stacking
context. You should place this element as a child of `<body>` whenever possible.
## &lt;iron-overlay-backdrop&gt;
`iron-overlay-backdrop` is a backdrop used by `Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior`. It should be a
singleton.
### Styling
The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling.
| Custom property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--iron-overlay-backdrop-background-color` | Backdrop background color | #000 |
| `--iron-overlay-backdrop-opacity` | Backdrop opacity | 0.6 |
| `--iron-overlay-backdrop` | Mixin applied to `iron-overlay-backdrop`. | {} |
| `--iron-overlay-backdrop-opened` | Mixin applied to `iron-overlay-backdrop` when it is displayed | {} |
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-overlay-behavior),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-overlay-behavior/demo/demo/index.html).

## IronResizableBehavior
`IronResizableBehavior` is a behavior that can be used in Polymer elements to
coordinate the flow of resize events between "resizers" (elements that control the
size or hidden state of their children) and "resizables" (elements that need to be
notified when they are resized or un-hidden by their parents in order to take
action on their new measurements).
Elements that perform measurement should add the `IronResizableBehavior` behavior to
their element definition and listen for the `iron-resize` event on themselves.
This event will be fired when they become showing after having been hidden,
when they are resized explicitly by another resizable, or when the window has been
resized.
Note, the `iron-resize` event is non-bubbling.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-resizable-behavior),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-resizable-behavior/demo/demo/index.html).

## IronValidatableBehavior
Use `IronValidatableBehavior` to implement an element that validates user input. By using this behaviour, your custom element will get a public `validate()` method, which
will return the validity of the element, and a corresponding `invalid` attribute,
which can be used for styling. Can be used alongside an element implementing
the  `IronValidatableBehavior` behaviour.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-validatable-behavior),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-validatable-behavior/demo/demo/index.html).

## &lt;paper-behaviors&gt;
`<paper-behaviors>` is a set of behaviours to help implement Material Design elements:
- `PaperCheckedElementBehavior` to implement a custom element
that has a `checked` property similar to `IronCheckedElementBehavior`
and is compatible with having a ripple effect.
- `PaperInkyFocusBehavior` implements a ripple when the element has keyboard focus.
- `PaperRippleBehavior` dynamically implements a ripple
when the element has focus via pointer or keyboard. This behavior is intended to be used in conjunction with and after
`IronButtonState` and `IronControlState`.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/paper-behaviors),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/paper-behaviors/demo/demo/index.html).

`paper-icon-button` is a button with an image placed at the center. When the user touches
the button, a ripple effect emanates from the center of the button.
`paper-icon-button` does not include a default icon set. To use icons from the default
set, include `@polymer/iron-icons/iron-icons.js`, and use the `icon` attribute to specify which icon
from the icon set to use.

## &lt;paper-item&gt;
`<paper-item>` is an interactive list item. By default, it is a horizontal flexbox.
```html
<paper-item>Item</paper-item>
```
Use this element with `<paper-item-body>` to make Material Design styled two-line and three-line
items.
```html
<paper-item>
  <paper-item-body two-line>
    <div>Show your status</div>
    <div secondary>Your status is visible to everyone</div>
  </paper-item-body>
  <iron-icon icon="warning"></iron-icon>
</paper-item>
```
To use `paper-item` as a link, wrap it in an anchor tag. Since `paper-item` will
already receive focus, you may want to prevent the anchor tag from receiving
focus as well by setting its tabindex to -1.
```html
<a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/" tabindex="-1">
  <paper-item raised>Polymer Project</paper-item>
</a>
```
If you are concerned about performance and want to use `paper-item` in a `paper-listbox`
with many items, you can just use a native `button` with the `paper-item` class
applied (provided you have correctly included the shared styles):
```html
<style is="custom-style" include="paper-item-shared-styles"></style>
<paper-listbox>
  <button class="paper-item" role="option">Inbox</button>
  <button class="paper-item" role="option">Starred</button>
  <button class="paper-item" role="option">Sent mail</button>
</paper-listbox>
```
### Styling
The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:
| Custom property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--paper-item-min-height` | Minimum height of the item | `48px` |
| `--paper-item` | Mixin applied to the item | `{}` |
| `--paper-item-selected-weight` | The font weight of a selected item | `bold` |
| `--paper-item-selected` | Mixin applied to selected paper-items | `{}` |
| `--paper-item-disabled-color` | The color for disabled paper-items | `--disabled-text-color` |
| `--paper-item-disabled` | Mixin applied to disabled paper-items | `{}` |
| `--paper-item-focused` | Mixin applied to focused paper-items | `{}` |
| `--paper-item-focused-before` | Mixin applied to :before focused paper-items | `{}` |
### Accessibility
This element has `role="listitem"` by default. Depending on usage, it may be more appropriate to set
`role="menuitem"`, `role="menuitemcheckbox"` or `role="menuitemradio"`.
```html
<paper-item role="menuitemcheckbox">
  <paper-item-body>
    Show your status
  </paper-item-body>
  <paper-checkbox></paper-checkbox>
</paper-item>
```
## &lt;paper-icon-item&gt;
`<paper-icon-item>` is a convenience element to make an item with icon. It is an interactive list
item with a fixed-width icon area, according to Material Design. This is useful if the icons are of
varying widths, but you want the item bodies to line up. Use this like a `<paper-item>`. The child
node with the slot `item-icon` is placed in the icon area.
```html
<paper-icon-item>
  <iron-icon icon="favorite" slot="item-icon"></iron-icon>
  Favorite
</paper-icon-item>
<paper-icon-item>
  <div class="avatar" slot="item-icon"></div>
  Avatar
</paper-icon-item>
```
### Styling
The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:
| Custom property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--paper-item-icon-width` | Width of the icon area | `56px` |
| `--paper-item-icon` | Mixin applied to the icon area | `{}` |
| `--paper-icon-item` | Mixin applied to the item | `{}` |
| `--paper-item-selected-weight` | The font weight of a selected item | `bold` |
| `--paper-item-selected` | Mixin applied to selected paper-items | `{}` |
| `--paper-item-disabled-color` | The color for disabled paper-items | `--disabled-text-color` |
| `--paper-item-disabled` | Mixin applied to disabled paper-items | `{}` |
| `--paper-item-focused` | Mixin applied to focused paper-items | `{}` |
| `--paper-item-focused-before` | Mixin applied to :before focused paper-items | `{}` |
### Changes in 2.0
Distribution is now done with the `slot="item-icon"` attributes (replacing the `item-icon` attribute):
    <paper-icon-item>
      <iron-icon icon="favorite" slot="item-icon"></iron-icon>
      Favorite
    </paper-icon-item>
## &lt;paper-item-body&gt;
Use `<paper-item-body>` in a `<paper-item>` or `<paper-icon-item>` to make two- or
three- line items. It is a flex item that is a vertical flexbox.
```html
<paper-item>
  <paper-item-body two-line>
    <div>Show your status</div>
    <div secondary>Your status is visible to everyone</div>
  </paper-item-body>
</paper-item>
```
The child elements with the `secondary` attribute is given secondary text styling.
### Styling
The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:
| Custom property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |

## &lt;paper-menu-button&gt;
`paper-menu-button` allows one to compose a designated "trigger" element with
another element that represents "content", to create a dropdown menu that
displays the "content" when the "trigger" is clicked.
The child element assigned to the `dropdown-trigger` slot will be used as the
"trigger" element. The child element assigned to the `dropdown-content` slot will be
used as the "content" element.
The `paper-menu-button` is sensitive to its content's `iron-select` events. If
the "content" element triggers an `iron-select` event, the `paper-menu-button`
will close automatically.
### Styling
The following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:
| Custom property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--paper-menu-button-dropdown-background` | Background color of the paper-menu-button dropdown | `--primary-background-color` |
| `--paper-menu-button` | Mixin applied to the paper-menu-button | `{}` |
| `--paper-menu-button-disabled` | Mixin applied to the paper-menu-button when disabled | `{}` |
| `--paper-menu-button-dropdown` | Mixin applied to the paper-menu-button dropdown | `{}` |
| `--paper-menu-button-content` | Mixin applied to the paper-menu-button content | `{}` |

## &lt;paper-listbox&gt;
`<paper-listbox>` implements an accessible listbox control with Material Design styling. The focused item
is highlighted, and the selected item has bolded text.
```html
<paper-listbox>
  <paper-item>Item 1</paper-item>
  <paper-item>Item 2</paper-item>
</paper-listbox>
```
An initial selection can be specified with the `selected` attribute.
```html
<paper-listbox selected="0">
  <paper-item>Item 1</paper-item>
  <paper-item>Item 2</paper-item>
</paper-listbox>
```
Make a multi-select listbox with the `multi` attribute. Items in a multi-select listbox can be deselected,
and multiple item can be selected.
```html
<paper-listbox multi>
  <paper-item>Item 1</paper-item>
  <paper-item>Item 2</paper-item>
</paper-listbox>
```
### Styling
The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:
| Custom property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--paper-listbox-background-color` | Menu background color | `--primary-background-color` |
| `--paper-listbox-color` | Menu foreground color | `--primary-text-color` |
| `--paper-listbox` | Mixin applied to the listbox | `{}` |
### Accessibility
`<paper-listbox>` has `role="listbox"` by default. A multi-select listbox will also have
`aria-multiselectable` set. It implements key bindings to navigate through the listbox with the up and
down arrow keys, esc to exit the listbox, and enter to activate a listbox item. Typing the first letter
of a listbox item will also focus it.

## &lt;iron-selector&gt;, `IronSelectableBehavior`, `IronMultiSelectableBehavior`
`iron-selector` is an element which can be used to manage a list of elements
that can be selected. Tapping on the item will make the item selected. The
`selected` indicates which item is being selected. The default is to use the
index of the item. `iron-selector`'s functionality is entirely defined by
`IronMultiSelectableBehavior`.
`IronSelectableBehavior` gives an element the concept of a selected child
element. By default, the element will select one of its selectable children
when a ['tap'
event](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/devguide/gesture-events#gesture-event-types)
(synthesized by Polymer, roughly 'click') is dispatched to it.
`IronSelectableBehavior` lets you ...
  - decide which children should be considered selectable (`selectable`),
  - retrieve the currently selected element (`selectedItem`) and all elements
    in the selectable set (`items`),
  - change the selection (`select`, `selectNext`, etc.),
  - decide how selected elements are modified to indicate their selected state
    (`selectedClass`, `selectedAttribute`),
... among other things.
`IronMultiSelectableBehavior` includes all the features of
`IronSelectableBehavior` as well as a `multi` property, which can be set to
`true` to indicate that the element can have multiple selected child elements.
It also includes the `selectedItems` and `selectedValues` properties for
working with arrays of selectable elements and their corresponding values
(`multi` is `true`) - similar to the single-item versions provided by
`IronSelectableBehavior`: `selectedItem` and `selected`.

The progress bars are for situations where the percentage completed can be
determined. They give users a quick sense of how much longer an operation
will take.
There is also a secondary progress which is useful for displaying intermediate
progress, such as the buffer level during a streaming playback progress bar.

@polymer/test-fixture@4.0.2  BSD-3-Clause  https://github.com/polymerelements/test-fixture/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[![Published on NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@polymer/test-fixture.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polymer/test-fixture)
[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/test-fixture.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/test-fixture)
[![Published on webcomponents.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/webcomponents.org-published-blue.svg)](https://webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/test-fixture)
##&lt;test-fixture&gt;
The `<test-fixture>` element can simplify the exercise of consistently
resetting a test suite's DOM.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/test-fixture).
To use it, wrap the test suite's DOM as a template:
```html
<test-fixture id="SomeElementFixture">
  <template>
    <some-element id="SomeElementForTesting"></some-element>
  </template>
</test-fixture>
```
Now, the `<test-fixture>` element can be used to generate a copy of its
template:
```html
<script>
  describe('<some-element>', function () {
    var someElement;
    beforeEach(function () {
      document.getElementById('SomeElementFixture').create();
      someElement = document.getElementById('SomeElementForTesting');
    });
  });
</script>
```
Fixtured elements can be cleaned up by calling `restore` on the `<test-fixture>`:
```javascript
  afterEach(function () {
    document.getElementById('SomeElementFixture').restore();
    // <some-element id='SomeElementForTesting'> has been removed
  });
```
`<test-fixture>` will create fixtures from all of its immediate `<template>`
children. The DOM structure of fixture templates can be as simple or as complex
as the situation calls for.
## Even simpler usage in Mocha
In Mocha, usage can be simplified even further. Include `test-fixture-mocha.js`
after Mocha in the `<head>` of your document and then fixture elements like so:
```html
<script>
  describe('<some-element>', function () {
    var someElement;
    beforeEach(function () {
      someElement = fixture('SomeElementFixture');
    });
  });
</script>
```
Fixtured elements will be automatically restored in the `afterEach` phase of the
current Mocha `Suite`.
## Data-bound templates
Data-binding systems are also supported, as long as your (custom) template
elements define a `stamp(model)` method that returns a document fragment. This
allows you to stamp out templates w/ custom models for your fixtures.
For example, using Polymer's `dom-bind`:
```html
<test-fixture id="bound">
  <dom-bind>
    <template>
      <span>{{greeting}}</span>
    </template>
  </dom-bind>
</test-fixture>
```
You can pass an optional context argument to `create()` or `fixture()` to pass
the model:
```js
var bound = fixture('bound', {greeting: 'ohai thurr'});
```
## The problem being addressed
Consider the following `web-component-tester` test suite:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>some-element test suite</title>
</head>
<body>
  <some-element id="SomeElementForTesting"></some-element>
  <script type="module">
    import '../some-element.js';
    describe('<some-element>', function () {
      var someElement;
      beforeEach(function () {
        someElement = document.getElementById('SomeElementForTesting');
      });
      it('can receive property `foo`', function () {
        someElement.foo = 'bar';
        expect(someElement.foo).to.be.equal('bar');
      });
      it('has a default `foo` value of `undefined`', function () {
        expect(someElement.foo).to.be.equal(undefined);
      });
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
In this contrived example, the suite will pass or fail depending on which order
the tests are run in. It is non-deterministic because `someElement` has
internal state that is not properly reset at the end of each test.
It would be trivial in the above example to simply reset `someElement.foo` to
the expected default value of `undefined` in an `afterEach` hook. However, for
non-contrived test suites that target complex elements, this can result in a
large quantity of ever-growing set-up and tear-down boilerplate.

## &lt;iron-a11y-keys-behavior&gt;
`Polymer.IronA11yKeysBehavior` provides a normalized interface for processing
keyboard commands that pertain to [WAI-ARIA best practices](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_general_binding).
The element takes care of browser differences with respect to Keyboard events
and uses an expressive syntax to filter key presses.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-a11y-keys-behavior),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-a11y-keys-behavior/demo/demo/index.html).
## Usage
### Installation
```
npm install --save @polymer/iron-a11y-keys-behavior
```
### In a Polymer 3 element
```js
import {PolymerElement, html} from '@polymer/polymer';
import {mixinBehaviors} from '@polymer/polymer/lib/legacy/class.js';
import {IronA11yKeysBehavior} from '@polymer/iron-a11y-keys-behavior/iron-a11y-keys-behavior.js';
class SampleElement extends  extends mixinBehaviors([IronA11yKeysBehavior], PolymerElement) {
  static get template() {
    return html`
      <pre>[[pressed]]</pre>
    `;
  }
  static get properties() {
    return {
      pressed: {type: String, readOnly: true, value: ''},
      keyBindings: {
        'space': '_onKeydown', // same as 'space:keydown'
        'shift+tab': '_onKeydown',
        'enter:keypress': '_onKeypress',
        'esc:keyup': '_onKeyup'
      }
    }
  }
  function _onKeydown: function(event) {
    console.log(event.detail.combo); // KEY+MODIFIER, e.g. "shift+tab"
    console.log(event.detail.key); // KEY only, e.g. "tab"
    console.log(event.detail.event); // EVENT, e.g. "keydown"
    console.log(event.detail.keyboardEvent); // the original KeyboardEvent

## &lt;iron-collapse&gt;
`iron-collapse` creates a collapsible block of content.  By default, the content
will be collapsed.  Use `opened` or `toggle()` to show/hide the content. The
aria-expanded attribute should only be set on the button that controls the
collapsable area, not on the area itself. See
https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_aria-expanded_to_indicate_the_state_of_a_collapsible_element#Description
`iron-collapse` adjusts the max-height/max-width of the collapsible element to show/hide
the content.  So avoid putting padding/margin/border on the collapsible directly,
and instead put a div inside and style that.
```html
<style>
  .collapse-content {
    padding: 15px;
    border: 1px solid #dedede;
  }
</style>
<iron-collapse>
  <div class="collapse-content">
    <div>Content goes here...</div>
  </div>
</iron-collapse>
```
### Styling
The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:
| Custom property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--iron-collapse-transition-duration` | Animation transition duration | `300ms` |
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-collapse),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-collapse/demo/demo/index.html).

## &lt;paper-toast&gt;
`paper-toast` provides a subtle notification toast. Only one `paper-toast` will
be visible on screen.
Use `opened` to show the toast:
Example:
```html
<paper-toast text="Hello world!" opened></paper-toast>
```
Also `open()` or `show()` can be used to show the toast:
Example:
```html
<paper-button on-click="openToast">Open Toast</paper-button>
<paper-toast id="toast" text="Hello world!"></paper-toast>
...
openToast: function() {
  this.$.toast.open();
}
```
Set `duration` to 0, a negative number or Infinity to persist the toast on screen:
Example:
```html
<paper-toast text="Terms and conditions" opened duration="0">
  <a href="#">Show more</a>
</paper-toast>
```
`<paper-toast>` is affected by the [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context) of its container. Adding `<paper-toast>` inside elements that create a new stacking context - e.g. `<app-drawer>`, `<app-layout>` or `<iron-list>` - might result in toasts partially obstructed or clipped. Add `<paper-toast>` to the top level (`<body>`) element, outside the structure, e.g.:
```html
  <!-- ... -->
  </app-drawer-layout>
  <paper-toast id="toast"></paper-toast>
</template>
```
You can then use custom events to communicate with it from within child components, using `addEventListener` and `dispatchEvent`.
### Styling
The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:
| Custom property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--paper-toast-background-color` | The paper-toast background-color | `#323232` |
| `--paper-toast-color` | The paper-toast color | `#f1f1f1` |
This element applies the mixin `--paper-font-common-base` but does not import `paper-styles/typography.html`.
In order to apply the `Roboto` font to this element, make sure you've imported `paper-styles/typography.html`.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/paper-toast),
  [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/paper-toast/demo/demo/index.html).
## Usage
### Installation
```
npm install --save @polymer/paper-toast
```
### In an html file
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="module">
      import '@polymer/paper-toast/paper-toast.js';
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <paper-toast text="Hello world!" opened></paper-toast>
  </body>
</html>
```
### In a Polymer 3 element
```js
import {PolymerElement, html} from '@polymer/polymer';
import '@polymer/paper-toast/paper-toast.js';
class SampleElement extends PolymerElement {
  static get template() {
    return html`
      <paper-toast text="Hello world!" opened></paper-toast>

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          the Derivative Works; and

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   1. Definitions.
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

@polymer/iron-dropdown@3.0.1  BSD-3-Clause  https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-dropdown/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[![Published on NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@polymer/iron-dropdown.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polymer/iron-dropdown)
[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/iron-dropdown.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/iron-dropdown)
[![Published on webcomponents.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/webcomponents.org-published-blue.svg)](https://webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-dropdown)
## &lt;iron-dropdown&gt;
`<iron-dropdown>` displays content inside a fixed-position container,
positioned relative to another element.
See: [Documentation](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-dropdown),
 [Demo](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/@polymer/iron-dropdown/demo/demo/index.html).
## Usage
### Installation
```
npm install --save @polymer/iron-dropdown
```
### In an HTML file
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="module">
      import '@polymer/iron-dropdown/iron-dropdown.js';
    </script>
    <style>
      #container {
        display: inline-block;
      }
      iron-dropdown {
        border: 1px solid gray;
        background: white;
        font-size: 2em;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="container">
      <button onclick="dropdown.open();">open the iron-dropdown</button>
      <iron-dropdown id="dropdown" no-overlap>
        <div slot="dropdown-content">Hello!</div>
      </iron-dropdown>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
### In a Polymer 3 element
```js
import {PolymerElement, html} from '@polymer/polymer';
import '@polymer/iron-dropdown/iron-dropdown.js';
class SampleElement extends PolymerElement {
  static get template() {
    return html`
      <style>
        :host {
          display: inline-block;
        }
        iron-dropdown {
          border: 1px solid gray;
          background: white;
          font-size: 2em;
        }
      </style>
      <button on-click="_openDropdown">open the dropdown</button>
      <iron-dropdown id="dropdown" horizontal-align="right" vertical-align="top">
        <div slot="dropdown-content">Hello!</div>
      </iron-dropdown>
    `;
  }
  _openDropdown() {
    this.$.dropdown.open();
  }
}
customElements.define('sample-element', SampleElement);
```
In the above example, the `<div>` assigned to the `dropdown-content` slot will
be hidden until the dropdown element has `opened` set to true, or when the
`open` method is called on the element.

agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)
This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.
#### Some subclasses:
Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!
 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS (v4a) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
Installation
------------
Install with `npm`:
``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```
Example
-------
Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):
```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');
var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});
// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```
Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:
```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```
Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:
```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```
API
---
## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]
Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.
The `options` object accepts the following properties:
  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).
The callback function should have the following signature:
### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined
The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.
If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

asn1.js@4.10.1  MIT  https://github.com/indutny/asn1.js/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ASN1.js
ASN.1 DER Encoder/Decoder and DSL.
## Example
Define model:
```javascript
var asn = require('asn1.js');
var Human = asn.define('Human', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('firstName').octstr(),
    this.key('lastName').octstr(),
    this.key('age').int(),
    this.key('gender').enum({ 0: 'male', 1: 'female' }),
    this.key('bio').seqof(Bio)
  );
});
var Bio = asn.define('Bio', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('time').gentime(),
    this.key('description').octstr()
  );
});
```
Encode data:
```javascript
var output = Human.encode({
  firstName: 'Thomas',
  lastName: 'Anderson',
  age: 28,
  gender: 'male',
  bio: [
    {
      time: +new Date('31 March 1999'),
      description: 'freedom of mind'
    }
  ]
}, 'der');
```
Decode data:
```javascript
var human = Human.decode(output, 'der');
console.log(human);
/*
{ firstName: <Buffer 54 68 6f 6d 61 73>,
  lastName: <Buffer 41 6e 64 65 72 73 6f 6e>,
  age: 28,
  gender: 'male',
  bio:
   [ { time: 922820400000,
       description: <Buffer 66 72 65 65 64 6f 6d 20 6f 66 20 6d 69 6e 64> } ] }
*/
```
### Partial decode
Its possible to parse data without stopping on first error. In order to do it,
you should call:
```javascript
var human = Human.decode(output, 'der', { partial: true });
console.log(human);
/*
{ result: { ... },
  errors: [ ... ] }
*/
```

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

assert-plus@1.0.0  MIT  https://github.com/mcavage/node-assert-plus/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# assert-plus
This library is a thin wrapper over the Node built-in `assert` module,
providing two main enhancements:
1. the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
   `NODE_NDEBUG`
2. some API wrappers for argument testing; e.g., `assert.string(myArg,
   'myArg')`.  As a simple example:
```javascript
var assert = require('assert-plus');
function fooAccount(options, callback) {
    assert.object(options, 'options');
    assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
    assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
    assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
    assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
    assert.func(callback, 'callback');
    // Do stuff
    callback(null, {});
}
```
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to submit changes.
## API
All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:
    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)
from:
```javascript
function test(foo) {
    assert.string(foo, 'foo');
}
```
There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:
```javascript
function test(foo) {
    assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
}
```
You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):
```javascript
assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```
Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.
The complete list of APIs is:
* `assert.array`
* `assert.bool`
* `assert.buffer`
* `assert.func`
* `assert.number`
* `assert.finite`
* `assert.object`
* `assert.string`
* `assert.stream`
* `assert.date`
* `assert.regexp`
* `assert.uuid`
* `assert.arrayOfArray`
* `assert.arrayOfBool`
* `assert.arrayOfBuffer`
* `assert.arrayOfFunc`
* `assert.arrayOfNumber`
* `assert.arrayOfFinite`
* `assert.arrayOfObject`
* `assert.arrayOfString`
* `assert.arrayOfStream`
* `assert.arrayOfDate`
* `assert.arrayOfRegexp`
* `assert.arrayOfUuid`
* `assert.optionalArray`
* `assert.optionalBool`
* `assert.optionalBuffer`
* `assert.optionalFunc`
* `assert.optionalNumber`
* `assert.optionalFinite`
* `assert.optionalObject`
* `assert.optionalString`
* `assert.optionalStream`
* `assert.optionalDate`
* `assert.optionalRegexp`
* `assert.optionalUuid`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfArray`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfBool`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfFunc`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfNumber`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfFinite`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfObject`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfString`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfStream`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfDate`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfUuid`
* `assert.AssertionError`
* `assert.fail`
* `assert.ok`
* `assert.equal`
* `assert.notEqual`
* `assert.deepEqual`
* `assert.notDeepEqual`
* `assert.strictEqual`
* `assert.notStrictEqual`
* `assert.throws`
* `assert.doesNotThrow`
* `assert.ifError`

# async-each
No-bullshit, ultra-simple, 35-lines-of-code async parallel forEach function for JavaScript.
We don't need junky 30K async libs. Really.
For browsers and node.js.
## Installation
* Just include async-each before your scripts.
* `npm install async-each` if you’re using node.js.
## Usage
* `each(array, iterator, callback);` — `Array`, `Function`, `(optional) Function`
* `iterator(item, next)` receives current item and a callback that will mark the item as done. `next` callback receives optional `error, transformedItem` arguments.
* `callback(error, transformedArray)` optionally receives first error and transformed result `Array`.
```javascript
var each = require('async-each');
each(['a.js', 'b.js', 'c.js'], fs.readFile, function(error, contents) {
  if (error) console.error(error);
  console.log('Contents for a, b and c:', contents);
});
// Alternatively in browser:
asyncEach(list, fn, callback);
```

## Intro
Babel is a tool that helps you write code in the latest version of JavaScript. When your supported environments don't support certain features natively, Babel will help you compile those features down to a supported version.
**In**
```js
// ES2015 arrow function
[1, 2, 3].map((n) => n + 1);
```
**Out**
```js
[1, 2, 3].map(function(n) {
  return n + 1;
});
```

## Intro
Babel is a tool that helps you write code in the latest version of JavaScript. When your supported environments don't support certain features natively, Babel will help you compile those features down to a supported version.
**In**
```js
// ES2015 arrow function
[1, 2, 3].map((n) => n + 1);
```
**Out**
```js
[1, 2, 3].map(function(n) {
  return n + 1;
});
```

## Intro
Babel is a tool that helps you write code in the latest version of JavaScript. When your supported environments don't support certain features natively, Babel will help you compile those features down to a supported version.
**In**
```js
// ES2015 arrow function
[1, 2, 3].map((n) => n + 1);
```
**Out**
```js
[1, 2, 3].map(function(n) {
  return n + 1;
});
```

bn.js@4.11.8  MIT  https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# <img src="./logo.png" alt="bn.js" width="160" height="160" />
> BigNum in pure javascript
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)
## Install
`npm install --save bn.js`
## Usage
```js
const BN = require('bn.js');
var a = new BN('dead', 16);
var b = new BN('101010', 2);
var res = a.add(b);
console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047
```
**Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.
## Notation
### Prefixes
There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here
is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:
* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on
  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs
* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or
  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations
  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be
  added to the result to make it positive
### Postfixes
* `n` - the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript
  Number. Decimals are not supported.
* `rn` - both argument and return value of the function are plain JavaScript
  Numbers. Decimals are not supported.
### Examples
* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`
* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value
* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13
## Instructions
Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be
either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).
### Utilities
* `a.clone()` - clone number
* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes
* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)
* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)
* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero
  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding
* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,
  which must behave like an `Array`
* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For
  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:
  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`
* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied
* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits
  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)
* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied
* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative
* `a.isEven()` - no comments
* `a.isOdd()` - no comments
* `a.isZero()` - no comments
* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)
  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)
* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)
* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)
* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width
* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width
* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance
* `BN.max(a, b)` - return `a` if `a` bigger than `b`
* `BN.min(a, b)` - return `a` if `a` less than `b`
### Arithmetics
* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)
* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)
* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)
* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`
* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)
* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)
* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division
### Bit operations
* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced
  with `andn` in future)
* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`
* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set
* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)
* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number
* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)
### Reduction
* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD
* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)
* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`
## Fast reduction
When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to
use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm
for [Mersenne Prime][1].
### Reduction context
To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:
```js
var red = BN.red(num);
```
where `num` is just a BN instance.
Or:
```js
var red = BN.red(primeName);
```
Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:
* `'k256'`
* `'p224'`
* `'p192'`
* `'p25519'`
Or:
```js
var red = BN.mont(num);
```
To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than
`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.
### Converting numbers
Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted
to it. Usually, this means that one should:
* Convert inputs to reducted ones
* Operate on them in reduction context
* Convert outputs back from the reduction context
Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:
```js
var redA = a.toRed(red);
```
Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above
Here is how to convert them back:
```js
var a = redA.fromRed();
```
### Red instructions
Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their
counterparts in red context:
* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`
* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`
* `a.redShl(num)`
* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`
* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`
* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime
* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number
* `a.redNeg()`
* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation
### Number Size
Optimized for elliptic curves that work with 256-bit numbers.
There is no limitation on the size of the numbers.

# better-assert
  Better c-style assertions using [callsite](https://github.com/visionmedia/callsite) for
  self-documenting failure messages.
## Installation
    $ npm install better-assert
## Example
 By default assertions are enabled, however the __NO_ASSERT__ environment variable 
 will deactivate them when truthy.
```js
var assert = require('better-assert');
test();
function test() {
  var user = { name: 'tobi' };
  assert('tobi' == user.name);
  assert('number' == typeof user.age);
}
AssertionError: 'number' == typeof user.age
    at test (/Users/tj/projects/better-assert/example.js:9:3)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/tj/projects/better-assert/example.js:4:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:449:26)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Buffer Alloc
A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.alloc`.
Works as Node.js: `v7.0.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`
## Installation
```sh
npm install --save buffer-alloc
```
## Usage
```js
const alloc = require('buffer-alloc')
console.log(alloc(4))
//=> <Buffer 00 00 00 00>
console.log(alloc(6, 0x41))
//=> <Buffer 41 41 41 41 41 41>
console.log(alloc(10, 'linus', 'utf8'))
//=> <Buffer 6c 69 6e 75 73 6c 69 6e 75 73>
```
## API
### alloc(size[, fill[, encoding]])
- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`
- `fill` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; A value to pre-fill the new `Buffer` with. **Default:** `0`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `fill` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`
Allocates a new `Buffer` of `size` bytes. If `fill` is `undefined`, the `Buffer` will be zero-filled.

# Buffer Fill
A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.fill`.
Works as Node.js: `v6.4.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`
## Installation
```sh
npm install --save buffer-fill
```
## Usage
```js
const fill = require('buffer-fill')
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(5)
console.log(buf.fill(8))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 08 08 08>
console.log(buf.fill(9, 2, 4))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 09 09 08>
console.log(buf.fill('linus', 'latin1'))
//=> <Buffer 6c 69 6e 75 73>
console.log(buf.fill('\u0222'))
//=> <Buffer c8 a2 c8 a2 c8>
```
## API
### fill(buf, value[, offset[, end]][, encoding])
- `value` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; The value to fill `buf` with
- `offset` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to start filling `buf`. **Default:** `0`
- `end` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to stop filling `buf` (not inclusive). **Default:** `buf.length`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `value` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`
- Return: &lt;Buffer&gt; A reference to `buf`
Fills `buf` with the specified `value`. If the `offset` and `end` are not given,
the entire `buf` will be filled. This is meant to be a small simplification to
allow the creation and filling of a `Buffer` to be done on a single line.
If the final write of a `fill()` operation falls on a multi-byte character, then
only the first bytes of that character that fit into `buf` are written.

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

buffer-alloc-unsafe@1.1.0  MIT  https://github.com/LinusU/buffer-alloc-unsafe/tree/master/readme.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Buffer Alloc Unsafe
A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.allocUnsafe`.
Works as Node.js: `v7.0.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`
## Installation
```sh
npm install --save buffer-alloc-unsafe
```
## Usage
```js
const allocUnsafe = require('buffer-alloc-unsafe')
console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 78 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 05 00>
console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 58 ed bf 5f ff 7f 00 00 01 00>
console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 50 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 0a 00>
allocUnsafe(-10)
//=> RangeError: "size" argument must not be negative
```
## API
### allocUnsafe(size)
- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`
Allocates a new *non-zero-filled* `Buffer` of `size` bytes. The `size` must be
less than or equal to the value of `buffer.kMaxLength` and greater than or equal
to zero. Otherwise, a `RangeError` is thrown.

boolbase@1.0.0  ISC  https://github.com/fb55/boolbase/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# boolbase
This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).
### WTF?
By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations.
Eg. [`css-select`](https://github.com/fb55/css-select) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements
If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even need to be touched.
### And why is this a separate module?
I'm trying to modularize `css-select` and most modules depend on these functions.
IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

=======================================================================
Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License
By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
Section 1 -- Definitions.
  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.
  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.
  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.
  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.
  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.
  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.
  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
Section 2 -- Scope.
  a. License grant.
       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
   in part; and
b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.
       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).
       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.
       5. Downstream recipients.
a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
   recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
   receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
   Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
   Public License.
b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
   any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
   apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
   Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
   Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
   Material.
       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
  b. Other rights.
       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.
       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.
       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
Section 3 -- License Conditions.
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.
  a. Attribution.
       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:
a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
   with the Licensed Material:
 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
    Material and any others designated to receive
    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
    designated);
ii. a copyright notice;
   iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
    warranties;
 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
    extent reasonably practicable;
b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
   retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
   Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
   hyperlink to, this Public License.
       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.
       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.
       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.
Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;
  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.
Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.
  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or
       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.
  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.
  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.
Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Section 8 -- Interpretation.
  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.
  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.
  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.
  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

# Chokidar [![Weekly downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/chokidar.svg)](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) [![Yearly downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dy/chokidar.svg)](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)
> A neat wrapper around Node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / FSEvents.
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)
Version 3 is out! Check out our blog post about it: [Chokidar 3: How to save 32TB of traffic every week](https://paulmillr.com/posts/chokidar-3-save-32tb-of-traffic/)
## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:
* Doesn't report filenames on MacOS.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.
Node.js `fs.watchFile`:
* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.
Chokidar resolves these problems.
Initially made for **[Brunch](https://brunch.io/)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](https://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/chokidar).
It has proven itself in production environments.
## How?
Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.
On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
`FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.
On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.
## Getting started
Install with npm:
```sh
npm install chokidar
```
Then `require` and use it in your code:
```javascript
const chokidar = require('chokidar');
// One-liner for current directory
chokidar.watch('.').on('all', (event, path) => {
  console.log(event, path);
});
```
## API
```javascript
// Example of a more typical implementation structure:
// Initialize watcher.
const watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../, // ignore dotfiles
  persistent: true
});
// Something to use when events are received.
const log = console.log.bind(console);
// Add event listeners.
watcher
  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))
  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));
// More possible events.
watcher
  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))
  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))
  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))
  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))
  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => { // internal
    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);
  });
// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second
// argument when available: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {
  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);
});
// Watch new files.
watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);
// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem
var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();
// Un-watch some files.
watcher.unwatch('new-file*');
// Stop watching.
// The method is async!
watcher.close().then(() => console.log('closed'));
// Full list of options. See below for descriptions.
// Do not use this example!
chokidar.watch('file', {
  persistent: true,
  ignored: '*.txt',
  ignoreInitial: false,
  followSymlinks: true,
  cwd: '.',
  disableGlobbing: false,
  usePolling: false,
  interval: 100,
  binaryInterval: 300,
  alwaysStat: false,
  depth: 99,
  awaitWriteFinish: {
    stabilityThreshold: 2000,
    pollInterval: 100
  },
  ignorePermissionErrors: false,
  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)
});
```
`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`
* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.
    - Note: globs must not contain windows separators (`\`),
    because that's how they work by the standard —
    you'll need to replace them with forward slashes (`/`).
    - Note 2: for additional glob documentation, check out low-level
    library: [picomatch](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch).
* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:
#### Persistence
* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.
#### Path filtering
* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[`fs.Stats`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object of that path).
* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).
* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.
#### Performance
* `usePolling` (default: `false`).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is
typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over
a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the
`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)
  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling, in milliseconds. You may also
    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
  polling for binary files.
  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the
`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.
* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.
* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).
By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust
  timing params:*
  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in
  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval, in milliseconds.
#### Errors
* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files
that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`
or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.
* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
"atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event
rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in
milliseconds.
### Methods & Events
`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:
* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,
`raw`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.  `raw` is internal, use it carefully.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files. Asynchronous, returns Promise.
* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.
## CLI
If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to
execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.
## Install Troubleshooting
* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`
  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is
    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
    Chokidar should function properly.
* `TypeError: fsevents is not a constructor`
  * Update chokidar by doing `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json yarn.lock && npm install`, or update your dependency that uses chokidar.
* Chokidar is producing `ENOSP` error on Linux, like this:
  * `bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device bash: no job control in this shell`
  `Error: watch /home/ ENOSPC`
  * This means Chokidar ran out of file handles and you'll need to increase their count by executing the following command in Terminal:
  `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`

cjson@0.2.1  MIT  https://github.com/kof/node-cjson/tree/master/readme.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kof/node-cjson.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kof/node-cjson)
## CJSON (Commented JavaScript Object Notation) is a comments enabled json config loader.
JSON has a good spec, is implemented in every language, has easy to read syntax and is much more powerful than ini files.
JSON is perfect for writing config files, except of one problem - there are no comments, but sometimes config files get large and need to be commented.
Well, you could just evaluate json file as a JavaScript using one-liner, right?
The purpose of this module is to avoid dirty JavaScript configs and to enable clean, consistent, secure, portable and JSON valid notation.
CJSON supports JavaScript style comments: singleline "//" and  multiline "/**/". It takes care about comments inside of strings.
Example of such shiny config file:
```javascript
/*
 * This is my app configuration file.
 *
 */
{
	"host": "localhost",
	// app is listening on this port
	"port": 8888
}
```
## API
### load the module
	var cjson = require('cjson');
### cjson.load(path, [options]);
Load config file from given path, array of paths or directory. Second parameter is optional and can be a boolean or object.
- `path` {String|Array} absolute path to the file, array of paths or directory
- `options` {Boolean|Object} optional options. If you pass `true` as second param, its the same as `{merge: true}` and will merge all configs together.
`options` defaults:
```javascript
{
    // deep merge all passed/found config files, see `cjson.extend`
    merge: false,
    // allows you to do some string replacements, see `cjson.replace`.
    replace: null,
    // freeze config recursively, see `cjson.freeze`
    freeze: false,
    // you can use any other extension for your config files, f.e. .cjson
    ext: '.json',
    // you can use any parser you want. the default uses JSON.parse for maximum
    // speed, if it throws it uses uses an alternative parser to give more
    // helpful errors
    parse: jph.parse
}
```
Examples:
```javascript
// just one config
var conf = cjson.load('/path/to/your/config.json');
// array of configs
var conf = cjson.load(['/path/to/your/config1.json', '/path/to/your/config2.json']);
//output
{
	config1: {key1: 'value1'}
	config2: {key2: 'value2'}
}
// use optional merge parameter
// array of configs
var conf = cjson.load(['/path/to/your/config1.json', '/path/to/your/config2.json'], true);
// output
{
	key1: 'value1',
	key2: 'value2'
}
// load all config files from a directory
var conf = cjson.load('/path/to/your/configs');
// overwriting dev config with production
var paths = ['/path/to/conf.json'];
if (process.env.NODE_ENV ==='production') {
	paths.push('/path/to/conf-prod.json');
}
var conf = cjson.load(paths, true);
```
### cjson.extend([deep], target, object1, [objectN])
Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object.
- `deep` If true, the merge becomes recursive.
- `target` The object to extend. It will receive the new properties.
- `object1` An object containing additional properties to merge in.
- `objectN` Additional objects containing properties to merge in.
Example:
```javascript
var object = cjson.extend({}, object1, object2);
```
### cjson.decomment(str)
Remove JavaScript style comments, singleline - '//' and multiline - '/**/'. It takes care
of comments inside of strings and escaping.
### cjson.parse(str, [reviver])
Like `JSON.parse`, but it takes care of comments. Optional `reviver` argument
is for `JSON.parse` method and will be called for every key and value at every level
of the final result.
### cjson.replace(str, obj)
Replace all strings `{{key}}` contained in `{key: 'value'}`, where `key` can be any
property of the passed `obj`.
Example:
```javascript
var str = '{"path": "{{root}}/src"}'; // json file contents
cjson.replace(str, {root: '/usr'}); // '{"path": "/usr/src"}'
```
### cjson.freeze(obj)
Recursively freeze an object.
## Installation
	npm install cjson

                                 Apache License
           Version 2.0, January 2004
        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   1. Definitions.
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

dom-serialize@2.2.1  MIT  https://github.com/webmodules/dom-serialize/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dom-serialize
=============
### Serializes any DOM node into a String
[![Sauce Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/dom-serialize.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/dom-serialize)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/webmodules/dom-serialize.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/webmodules/dom-serialize)
It's like `outerHTML`, but it works with:
 * DOM elements
 * Text nodes
 * Attributes
 * Comment nodes
 * Documents
 * DocumentFragments
 * Doctypes
 * NodeLists / Arrays
For custom serialization logic, a "serialize" event is dispatched on
every `Node` which event listeners can override the default behavior on by
setting the `event.detail.serialize` property to a String or other Node.
The "serialize" event bubbles, so it could be a good idea to utilize
event delegation on a known root node that will be serialized.
Check the `event.serializeTarget` property to check which `Node` is
currently being serialized.
Installation
------------
``` bash
$ npm install dom-serialize
```
Example
-------
``` js
var serialize = require('dom-serialize');
var node;
// works with Text nodes
node = document.createTextNode('foo & <bar>');
console.log(serialize(node));
// works with DOM elements
node = document.createElement('body');
node.appendChild(document.createElement('strong'));
node.firstChild.appendChild(document.createTextNode('hello'));
console.log(serialize(node));
// custom "serialize" event
node.firstChild.addEventListener('serialize', function (event) {
  event.detail.serialize = 'pwn';
}, false);
console.log(serialize(node));
// you can also just pass a function in for a one-time serializer
console.log(serialize(node, function (event) {
  if (event.serializeTarget === node.firstChild) {
    // for the first child, output an ellipsis to summarize "content"
    event.detail.serialze = '…';
  } else if (event.serializeTarget !== node) {
    // any other child
    event.preventDefault();
  }
}));
```
```
foo &amp; &lt;bar&gt;
<body><strong>hello</strong></body>
<body>pwn</body>
<body>…</body>
```

ebnf-parser@0.1.10  MIT  https://github.com/zaach/ebnf-parser/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ebnf-parser
A parser for BNF and EBNF grammars used by jison.
## install
    npm install ebnf-parser
## build
To build the parser yourself, clone the git repo then run:
    make
This will generate `parser.js`, which is required by `ebnf-parser.js`.
## usage
The parser translates a string grammar or JSON grammar into a JSON grammar that jison can use (ENBF is transformed into BNF).
    var ebnfParser = require('ebnf-parser');
    // parse a bnf or ebnf string grammar
    ebnfParser.parse("%start ... %");
    // transform an ebnf JSON gramamr
    ebnfParser.transform({"ebnf": ...});
## example grammar
The parser can parse its own BNF grammar, shown below:
    %start spec
    /* grammar for parsing jison grammar files */
    %{
    var transform = require('./ebnf-transform').transform;
    var ebnf = false;
    %}
    %%

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

[![Saucelabs Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/gh-indutny-elliptic.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/gh-indutny-elliptic)
Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.
NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.
## Incentive
ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.
## Benchmarks
```bash
$ node benchmarks/index.js
Benchmarking: sign
elliptic#sign x 262 ops/sec ±0.51% (177 runs sampled)
eccjs#sign x 55.91 ops/sec ±0.90% (144 runs sampled)
------------------------
Fastest is elliptic#sign
========================
Benchmarking: verify
elliptic#verify x 113 ops/sec ±0.50% (166 runs sampled)
eccjs#verify x 48.56 ops/sec ±0.36% (125 runs sampled)

## API
### ECDSA
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');
// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();
// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash);
// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();
// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));
// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY
var pubPoint = key.getPublic();
var x = pubPoint.getX();
var y = pubPoint.getY();
// Public Key MUST be either:
// 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or
// 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or
// 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y)
var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1
var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2
var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3
var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3
// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');
// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or
// 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)
var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3
// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```
### EdDSA
```javascript
var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;
// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');
// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer
// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();
// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY
// Import public key
var pub = '0a1af638...';
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');
// Verify signature
var signature = '70bed1...';
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```
### ECDH
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');
// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();
var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());
console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
```
three and more members:
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');
var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();
var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())
var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())
console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
```
NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.
## Supported curves
Elliptic.js support following curve types:
* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards
Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:
* `secp256k1`
* `p192`
* `p224`
* `p256`
* `p384`
* `p521`
* `curve25519`
* `ed25519`
NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.
### Implementation details
ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.
All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]
### Related projects
* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

# node-errno
> Better [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)/[io.js](https://iojs.org) error handling & reporting. Available in npm as *errno*.

* [Custom errors](#customerrors)
<a name="errnoexposed"></a>
## errno exposed
Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.
**By errno:**
```js
require('errno').errno[3]
// → {
//     "errno": 3,
//     "code": "EACCES",
//     "description": "permission denied"
//   }
```
**By code:**
```js
require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY
// → {
//     "errno": 53,
//     "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
//     "description": "directory not empty"
//   }
```
**Make your errors more descriptive:**
```js
var errno = require('errno')
function errmsg(err) {
  var str = 'Error: '
  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message
  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
  if (err.path)
    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'
  return str
}
var fs = require('fs')
fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
```
**Use as a command line tool:**
```
~ $ errno 53
{
  "errno": 53,
  "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
  "description": "directory not empty"
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  "errno": 56,
  "code": "EROFS",
  "description": "read-only file system"
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: "foo"
```
Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.
You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.
<a name="customerrors"></a>
## Custom errors
Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.
```js
var create = require('errno').custom.createError
var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)
// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')
if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
```
Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:
```js
fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
```
The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

       stating that You changed the files; and
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

> ESLint rules for Jasmine
## Usage
1. Install `eslint-plugin-jasmine` as a dev-dependency:
    ```shell
    npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-jasmine
    ```
2. Enable the plugin by adding it to your `.eslintrc`:
    ```yaml
    plugins:
      - jasmine
    ```
ESLint itself provides a [Jasmine environment][env] for Jasmine's global
variables. It's therefore recommended to also enable it in your `.eslintrc`:
```yaml
plugins:
  - jasmine
env:
  jasmine: true
```
By default, no rules are enabled. See the next section for more.
[env]: http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-environments
## Configuration
This plugin exports a `recommended` configuration that enforces good practices.
To enable this configuration, use the `extends` property in your `.eslintrc`
config file:
```yaml
plugins:
  - jasmine
env:
  jasmine: true
extends: 'plugin:jasmine/recommended'
```
See the [ESLint config docs][] for more information about extending
configuration files.
[eslint config docs]: http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#extending-configuration-files

[no-spec-dupes][]                 | 1, `'block'`                       | `['block', 'branch']`
[no-suite-callback-args][]        | 2                                  |
[no-suite-dupes][]                | 1, `'block'`                       | `['block', 'branch']`
[no-unsafe-spy][]                 | 1                                  |

[prefer-jasmine-matcher][]        | 1                                  |
[prefer-toHaveBeenCalledWith][]   | 1                                  |
[prefer-toBeUndefined][]          | 0                                  | `['always', 'never']`
For example, using the recommended configuration, the `no-focused-tests` rule
is enabled and will cause ESLint to throw an error (with an exit code of `1`)
when triggered.
You may customise each rule by adding a value in your `.eslintrc` `rules`
property:
```yaml
plugins:
  - jasmine
env:
  jasmine: true
rules:
  jasmine/no-focused-tests: 0
  jasmine/no-suite-dupes:
    - 2
    - branch
```

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

es6-promisify@5.0.0  MIT  https://github.com/digitaldesignlabs/es6-promisify/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/digitaldesignlabs/es6-promisify.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/digitaldesignlabs/es6-promisify)
# es6-promisify
Converts callback-based functions to ES6/ES2015 Promises, using a boilerplate callback function.
NOTE: All-new API for Version 6.0.0; please read carefully!
===========================================================
## Install
Install with [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/es6-promisify)
```bash
npm install es6-promisify
```
## Example
```js
const {promisify} = require("es6-promisify");
// Convert the stat function
const fs = require("fs");
const stat = promisify(fs.stat);
// Now usable as a promise!
stat("example.txt").then(function (stats) {
    console.log("Got stats", stats);
}).catch(function (err) {
    console.error("Yikes!", err);
});
```
## Promisify methods
```js
const {promisify} = require("es6-promisify");
// Create a promise-based version of send_command
const redis = require("redis").createClient(6379, "localhost");
const client = promisify(redis.send_command.bind(redis));
// Send commands to redis and get a promise back
client("ping").then(function (pong) {
    console.log("Got", pong);
}).catch(function (err) {
    console.error("Unexpected error", err);
}).then(function () {
    redis.quit();
});
```
## Handle multiple callback arguments, with named parameters
```js
const {promisify} = require("es6-promisify");
function test(cb) {
    return cb(undefined, 1, 2, 3);
}
// Create promise-based version of test
test[promisify.argumentNames] = ["one", "two", "three"];
const multi = promisify(test);
// Returns named arguments
multi().then(result => {
    console.log(result); // {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3}
});
```
## Provide your own Promise implementation
```js
const {promisify} = require("es6-promisify");
// Now uses Bluebird
promisify.Promise = require("bluebird");
const test = promisify(cb => cb(undefined, "test"));
test().then(result => {
    console.log(result); // "test", resolved using Bluebird
});
```
### Tests
Test with tape
```bash
$ npm test
```
### Changes from v5.0.0
- Allow developer to specify a different implementations of `Promise`
- No longer ships with a polyfill for `Promise`. If your environment has no native `Promise` you must polyfill yourself, or set `promisify.Promise` to an A+ compatible `Promise` implementation.
- Removed support for `settings.thisArg`: use `.bind()` instead.
- Removed support for `settings.multiArgs`: use named arguments instead.

**Esprima** ([esprima.org](http://esprima.org), BSD license) is a high performance,
standard-compliant [ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
parser written in ECMAScript (also popularly known as
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)).
Esprima is created and maintained by [Ariya Hidayat](https://twitter.com/ariyahidayat),
with the help of [many contributors](https://github.com/jquery/esprima/contributors).
### Features
- Full support for ECMAScript 2017 ([ECMA-262 8th Edition](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm))
- Sensible [syntax tree format](https://github.com/estree/estree/blob/master/es5.md) as standardized by [ESTree project](https://github.com/estree/estree)
- Experimental support for [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/), a syntax extension for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- Optional tracking of syntax node location (index-based and line-column)
- [Heavily tested](http://esprima.org/test/ci.html) (~1500 [unit tests](https://github.com/jquery/esprima/tree/master/test/fixtures) with [full code coverage](https://codecov.io/github/jquery/esprima))
### API
Esprima can be used to perform [lexical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) (tokenization) or [syntactic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) (parsing) of a JavaScript program.
A simple example on Node.js REPL:
```javascript
> var esprima = require('esprima');
> var program = 'const answer = 42';
> esprima.tokenize(program);
[ { type: 'Keyword', value: 'const' },
  { type: 'Identifier', value: 'answer' },
  { type: 'Punctuator', value: '=' },
  { type: 'Numeric', value: '42' } ]
  
> esprima.parseScript(program);
{ type: 'Program',
  body:
   [ { type: 'VariableDeclaration',
       declarations: [Object],
       kind: 'const' } ],
  sourceType: 'script' }
```

esrecurse@4.2.1  BSD-2-Clause  https://github.com/estools/esrecurse/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)
Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is
[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
recursive traversing functionality.
### Example Usage
The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.
```javascript
esrecurse.visit(ast, {
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});
```
We can use `Visitor` instance.
```javascript
var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});
visitor.visit(ast);
```
We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.
```javascript
class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {
    constructor()
    {
        super(null);
    }
    XXXStatement(node) {
    }
}
```
```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    this.visit(node.left);
    // do something...
    this.visit(node.right);
};
```
And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.
```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    // do something...
    this.visitChildren(node);
};
```
The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`.
We can use user-defined node types.
```javascript
// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
var tree = {
    type: 'TestExpression',
    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: 20
    },
    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
// do something...
        }
    },
    {
        // Extending the existing traversing rules.
        childVisitorKeys: {
// TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]
TestExpression: ['argument']
        }
    }
);
```
We can use the `fallback` option as well.
If the `fallback` option is `"iteration"`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).
```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
// do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: 'iteration'
    }
);
```
If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).
```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
// do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: function (node) {
return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {
return key !== 'argument'
});
        }
    }
);
```

      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

faye-websocket@0.10.0  MIT  https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-node/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# faye-websocket [![Build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node)
This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the
[Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project. It provides classes for easily building
WebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but
rather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing
[Node](https://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction
other than the standard [WebSocket
API](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#network).
It also provides an abstraction for handling
[EventSource](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#server-sent-events)
connections, which are one-way connections that allow the server to push data to
the client. They are based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access
via proxies than WebSockets.
## Installation
```
$ npm install faye-websocket
```
## Handling WebSocket connections in Node
You can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade
requests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes
the usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this
is how you'd implement an echo server:
```js
var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),
    http      = require('http');
var server = http.createServer();
server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {
  if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {
    var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);
    ws.on('message', function(event) {
      ws.send(event.data);
    });
    ws.on('close', function(event) {
      console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);
      ws = null;
    });
  }
});
server.listen(8000);
```
`WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the
`ws.on('message', ...)` line with:
```js
    ws.pipe(ws);
```
Note that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting
through an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you
call `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire
handshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer
the message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any
buffered messages will be sent to the client.
If you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the
`onopen` event.
If the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to
send a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a
message string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message
is received. It returns `true` if and only if a ping message was sent. If the
client does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns
`false`.
```js
ws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {
  // fires when pong is received
});
```
## Using the WebSocket client
The client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss`
protocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web
browser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.
```js
var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),
    ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');
ws.on('open', function(event) {
  console.log('open');
  ws.send('Hello, world!');
});
ws.on('message', function(event) {
  console.log('message', event.data);
});
ws.on('close', function(event) {
  console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);
  ws = null;
});
```
The WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the
handshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.
To connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy,
including any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you
require. Only the `origin` setting is required.
```js
var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', [], {
  proxy: {
    origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',
    headers: { 'User-Agent': 'node' },
    tls:     { cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt') }
  }
});
```
The `tls` value is an object that will be passed to
[`tls.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).
## Subprotocol negotiation
The WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application
protocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which
protocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you
construct the socket:
```js
var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']);
```
On the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server
supports after the other constructor arguments:
```js
var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']);
```
If the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side
socket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.
## Protocol extensions
faye-websocket is based on the
[websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)
framework that allows extensions to be negotiated via the
`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. To add extensions to a connection, pass an
array of extensions to the `:extensions` option. For example, to add
[permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node):
```js
var deflate = require('permessage-deflate');
var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, [], { extensions: [deflate] });
```
## Initialization options
Both the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in
at initialization time, for example:
```js
var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options);
var ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options);
```
`protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`.
`options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:
- `extensions` - an array of
  [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)
  compatible extensions, as described above
- `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to
  be sent during the handshake process
- `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.
  The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB.
- `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping frames,
  measured in seconds
The client accepts some additional options:
- `proxy` - settings for a proxy as described above
- `net` - an object containing settings for the origin server that will be
  passed to
  [`net.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_connect_options_connectlistener)
- `tls` - an object containing TLS settings for the origin server, this will be
  passed to
  [`tls.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback)
- `ca` - (legacy) a shorthand for passing `{ tls: { ca: value } }`
## WebSocket API
Both server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.
- **`on('open', function(event) {})`** fires when the socket connection is
  established. Event has no attributes.
- **`on('message', function(event) {})`** fires when the socket receives a
  message. Event has one attribute, **`data`**, which is either a `String` (for
  text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames).
- **`on('error', function(event) {})`** fires when there is a protocol error due
  to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational, you do
  not need to implement error recover.
- **`on('close', function(event) {})`** fires when either the client or the
  server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, **`code`**
  and **`reason`**, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer
  that closed the connection.
- **`send(message)`** accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a text
  or binary message over the connection to the other peer.
- **`ping(message, function() {})`** sends a ping frame with an optional message
  and fires the callback when a matching pong is received.
- **`close(code, reason)`** closes the connection, sending the given status code
  and reason text, both of which are optional.
- **`version`** is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket` protocol
  the connection is using.
- **`protocol`** is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol
  the socket is using.
## Handling EventSource connections in Node
EventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they
only allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API.
EventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each
message has an optional event-type and ID.
```js
var WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),
    EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,
    http        = require('http');
var server = http.createServer();
server.on('request', function(request, response) {
  if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {
    var es = new EventSource(request, response);
    console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);
    // Periodically send messages
    var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);
    es.on('close', function() {
      clearInterval(loop);
      es = null;
    });
  } else {
    // Normal HTTP request
    response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    response.end('Hello');
  }
});
server.listen(8000);
```
The `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default
event-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification`
event with ID `99`:
```js
es.send('Breaking News!', { event: 'notification', id: '99' });
```
The `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:
- **`url`** is a string containing the URL the client used to create the
  EventSource.
- **`lastEventId`** is a string containing the last event ID received by the
  client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection
  to determine which messages need resending.
When you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass
configuration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:
- **`headers`** is an object containing custom headers to be set on the
  EventSource response.
- **`retry`** is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it should
  wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect.
- **`ping`** is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send
  'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts
  set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.
For example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings
every 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:
```js
var es = new EventSource(request, response, {
  headers: { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*' },
  ping:    15,
  retry:   10
});
```
You can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike
WebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send
some data over the wire to keep the connection alive.

For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.
"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

https-proxy-agent@2.2.1  MIT  https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)
This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.
Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.
Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.
Installation
------------
Install with `npm`:
``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```
Examples
--------
#### `https` module example
``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');
// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);
// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);
// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;
https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```
#### `ws` WebSocket connection example
``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');
// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);
// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);
// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);
// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });
socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});
socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```
API
---
### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)
The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].
The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:
  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

# ICSS Utils
## replaceSymbols
Governs the way tokens are searched & replaced during the linking stage of ICSS loading.
This is broken into its own module in case the behaviour needs to be replicated in other PostCSS plugins
(i.e. [CSS Modules Values](https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules-values))
```js
import { replaceSymbols, replaceValueSymbols } from "icss-utils";
replaceSymbols(css, replacements);
replaceValueSymbols(string, replacements);
```
Where:
- `css` is the PostCSS tree you're working with
- `replacements` is an JS object of `symbol: "replacement"` pairs, where all occurrences of `symbol` are replaced with `replacement`.
A symbol is a string of alphanumeric, `-` or `_` characters. A replacement can be any string. They are replaced in the following places:
- In the value of a declaration, i.e. `color: my_symbol;` or `box-shadow: 0 0 blur spread shadow-color`
- In a media expression i.e. `@media small {}` or `@media screen and not-large {}`
## extractICSS(css, removeRules = true)
Extracts and remove (if removeRules is equal true) from PostCSS tree `:import` and `:export` statements.
```js
import postcss from "postcss";
import { extractICSS } from "icss-utils";
const css = postcss.parse(`
  :import(colors) {
    a: b;
  }
  :export {
    c: d;
  }
`);
extractICSS(css);
/*
  {
    icssImports: {
      colors: {
        a: 'b'
      }
    },
    icssExports: {
      c: 'd'
    }
  }
*/
```
## createICSSRules(icssImports, icssExports)
Converts icss imports and exports definitions to postcss ast

# ignore
`ignore` is a manager, filter and parser which implemented in pure JavaScript according to the [.gitignore spec 2.22.1](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
`ignore` is used by eslint, gitbook and [many others](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/ignore).
Pay attention that [`minimatch`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/minimatch) does not work in the gitignore way. To filter filenames according to .gitignore file, I recommend this module.
### Tested on
`ignore` is fully tested, and has more than **five hundreds** of unit tests.
- Linux + Node: `0.8` - `7.x`
- Windows + Node: `0.10` - `7.x`, node < `0.10` is not tested due to the lack of support of appveyor.
Actually, `ignore` does not rely on any versions of node specially.
Since `4.0.0`, ignore will no longer support `node < 6` by default, to use in node < 6, `require('ignore/legacy')`. For details, see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kaelzhang/node-ignore/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
## Table Of Main Contents
- [Usage](#usage)
- [`Pathname` Conventions](#pathname-conventions)
- See Also:
  - [`glob-gitignore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-gitignore) matches files using patterns and filters them according to gitignore rules.
- [Upgrade Guide](#upgrade-guide)
## Install
```sh
npm i ignore
```
## Usage
```js
import ignore from 'ignore'
const ig = ignore().add(['.abc/*', '!.abc/d/'])
```
### Filter the given paths
```js
const paths = [
  '.abc/a.js',    // filtered out
  '.abc/d/e.js'   // included
]
ig.filter(paths)        // ['.abc/d/e.js']
ig.ignores('.abc/a.js') // true
```
### As the filter function
```js
paths.filter(ig.createFilter()); // ['.abc/d/e.js']
```
### Win32 paths will be handled
```js
ig.filter(['.abc\\a.js', '.abc\\d\\e.js'])
// if the code above runs on windows, the result will be
// ['.abc\\d\\e.js']
```
## Why another ignore?
- `ignore` is a standalone module, and is much simpler so that it could easy work with other programs, unlike [isaacs](https://npmjs.org/~isaacs)'s [fstream-ignore](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream-ignore) which must work with the modules of the fstream family.
- `ignore` only contains utility methods to filter paths according to the specified ignore rules, so
  - `ignore` never try to find out ignore rules by traversing directories or fetching from git configurations.
  - `ignore` don't cares about sub-modules of git projects.
- Exactly according to [gitignore man page](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), fixes some known matching issues of fstream-ignore, such as:
  - '`/*.js`' should only match '`a.js`', but not '`abc/a.js`'.
  - '`**/foo`' should match '`foo`' anywhere.
  - Prevent re-including a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.
  - Handle trailing whitespaces:
    - `'a '`(one space) should not match `'a  '`(two spaces).
    - `'a \ '` matches `'a  '`
  - All test cases are verified with the result of `git check-ignore`.
# Methods
## .add(pattern: string | Ignore): this
## .add(patterns: Array<string | Ignore>): this
- **pattern** `String | Ignore` An ignore pattern string, or the `Ignore` instance
- **patterns** `Array<String | Ignore>` Array of ignore patterns.
Adds a rule or several rules to the current manager.
Returns `this`
Notice that a line starting with `'#'`(hash) is treated as a comment. Put a backslash (`'\'`) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash, if you want to ignore a file with a hash at the beginning of the filename.
```js
ignore().add('#abc').ignores('#abc')    // false
ignore().add('\#abc').ignores('#abc')   // true
```
`pattern` could either be a line of ignore pattern or a string of multiple ignore patterns, which means we could just `ignore().add()` the content of a ignore file:
```js
ignore()
.add(fs.readFileSync(filenameOfGitignore).toString())
.filter(filenames)
```
`pattern` could also be an `ignore` instance, so that we could easily inherit the rules of another `Ignore` instance.
## <strike>.addIgnoreFile(path)</strike>
REMOVED in `3.x` for now.
To upgrade `ignore@2.x` up to `3.x`, use
```js
import fs from 'fs'
if (fs.existsSync(filename)) {
  ignore().add(fs.readFileSync(filename).toString())
}
```
instead.
## .filter(paths: Array&lt;Pathname&gt;): Array&lt;Pathname&gt;
```ts
type Pathname = string
```
Filters the given array of pathnames, and returns the filtered array.
- **paths** `Array.<Pathname>` The array of `pathname`s to be filtered.
### `Pathname` Conventions:
#### 1. `Pathname` should be a `path.relative()`d pathname
`Pathname` should be a string that have been `path.join()`ed, or the return value of `path.relative()` to the current directory,
```js
// WRONG, an error will be thrown
ig.ignores('./abc')
// WRONG, for it will never happen, and an error will be thrown
// If the gitignore rule locates at the root directory,
// `'/abc'` should be changed to `'abc'`.
// ```
// path.relative('/', '/abc')  -> 'abc'
// ```
ig.ignores('/abc')
// WRONG, that it is an absolute path on Windows, an error will be thrown
ig.ignores('C:\\abc')
// Right
ig.ignores('abc')
// Right
ig.ignores(path.join('./abc'))  // path.join('./abc') -> 'abc'
```
In other words, each `Pathname` here should be a relative path to the directory of the gitignore rules.
Suppose the dir structure is:
```
/path/to/your/repo
    |-- a
    |   |-- a.js
    |
    |-- .b
    |
    |-- .c
         |-- .DS_store
```
Then the `paths` might be like this:
```js
[
  'a/a.js'
  '.b',
  '.c/.DS_store'
]
```
#### 2. filenames and dirnames
`node-ignore` does NO `fs.stat` during path matching, so for the example below:
```js
// First, we add a ignore pattern to ignore a directory
ig.add('config/')
// `ig` does NOT know if 'config', in the real world,
//   is a normal file, directory or something.
ig.ignores('config')
// `ig` treats `config` as a file, so it returns `false`
ig.ignores('config/')
// returns `true`
```
Specially for people who develop some library based on `node-ignore`, it is important to understand that.
Usually, you could use [`glob`](http://npmjs.org/package/glob) with `option.mark = true` to fetch the structure of the current directory:
```js
import glob from 'glob'
glob('**', {
  // Adds a / character to directory matches.
  mark: true
}, (err, files) => {
  if (err) {
    return console.error(err)
  }
  let filtered = ignore().add(patterns).filter(files)
  console.log(filtered)
})
```
## .ignores(pathname: Pathname): boolean
> new in 3.2.0
Returns `Boolean` whether `pathname` should be ignored.
```js
ig.ignores('.abc/a.js')    // true
```
## .createFilter()
Creates a filter function which could filter an array of paths with `Array.prototype.filter`.
Returns `function(path)` the filter function.
## .test(pathname: Pathname) since 5.0.0
Returns `TestResult`
```ts
interface TestResult {
  ignored: boolean
  // true if the `pathname` is finally unignored by some negative pattern
  unignored: boolean
}
```
- `{ignored: true, unignored: false}`: the `pathname` is ignored
- `{ignored: false, unignored: true}`: the `pathname` is unignored
- `{ignored: false, unignored: false}`: the `pathname` is never matched by any ignore rules.
## `options.ignorecase` since 4.0.0
Similar as the `core.ignorecase` option of [git-config](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config), `node-ignore` will be case insensitive if `options.ignorecase` is set to `true` (the default value), otherwise case sensitive.
```js
const ig = ignore({
  ignorecase: false
})
ig.add('*.png')
ig.ignores('*.PNG')  // false
```
## static `ignore.isPathValid(pathname): boolean` since 5.0.0
Check whether the `pathname` is valid according to the [convention](#1-pathname-should-be-a-pathrelatived-pathname).
```js
ignore.isPathValid('./foo')  // false
```
****
# Upgrade Guide
## Upgrade 4.x -> 5.x
Since `5.0.0`, if an invalid `Pathname` passed into `ig.ignores()`, an error will be thrown, while `ignore < 5.0.0` did not make sure what the return value was, as well as
```ts
.ignores(pathname: Pathname): boolean
.filter(pathnames: Array<Pathname>): Array<Pathname>
.createFilter(): (pathname: Pathname) => boolean
.test(pathname: Pathname): {ignored: boolean, unignored: boolean}
```
See the convention [here](#1-pathname-should-be-a-pathrelatived-pathname) for details.
If there are invalid pathnames, the conversion and filtration should be done by users.
```js
import {isPathValid} from 'ignore' // introduced in 5.0.0
const paths = [
  // invalid
  //////////////////
  '',
  false,
  '../foo',
  '.',
  //////////////////
  // valid
  'foo'
]
.filter(isValidPath)
ig.filter(paths)
```
## Upgrade 3.x -> 4.x
Since `4.0.0`, `ignore` will no longer support node < 6, to use `ignore` in node < 6:
```js
var ignore = require('ignore/legacy')
```
## Upgrade 2.x -> 3.x
- All `options` of 2.x are unnecessary and removed, so just remove them.
- `ignore()` instance is no longer an [`EventEmitter`](nodejs.org/api/events.html), and all events are unnecessary and removed.
- `.addIgnoreFile()` is removed, see the [.addIgnoreFile](#addignorefilepath) section for details.

imurmurhash@0.1.4  MIT  https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iMurmurHash.js
==============
An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).
This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.
Installation
------------
To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```
---
To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:
```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```
Then simply include it in your scripts:
```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```
Quick Example
-------------
```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');
// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');
// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');
// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```
Functions
---------
### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:
```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...
// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```
Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.
---
### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.
---
### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.
```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328
// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```
---
### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

# A JavaScript Testing Framework
Jasmine is a Behavior Driven Development testing framework for JavaScript. It does not rely on browsers, DOM, or any JavaScript framework. Thus it's suited for websites, [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) projects, or anywhere that JavaScript can run.
Documentation & guides live here: [http://jasmine.github.io](http://jasmine.github.io/)
For a quick start guide of Jasmine, see the beginning of [http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html](http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html)
Upgrading from Jasmine 2.x? Check out the [3.0 release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/v3.0.0/release_notes/3.0.md) for a list of what's new (including breaking changes).

# The Jasmine Module
The `jasmine` module is a package of helper code for developing Jasmine projects for Node.js. 
The core of jasmine lives at https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine and is `jasmine-core` in npm.
## Contents
This module allows you to run Jasmine specs for your Node.js code. The output will be displayed in your terminal by default.
## Documentation
https://jasmine.github.io/edge/node.html
## Installation
```sh
# Local installation:
npm install --save-dev jasmine
# Global installation
npm install -g jasmine
```
## Initializing
To initialize a project for Jasmine
`jasmine init`
To initialize a project for Jasmine when being installed locally
`node_modules/.bin/jasmine init`
or
`npx jasmine init`
To seed your project with some examples
`jasmine examples`
## Usage
To run your test suite
`jasmine`
## Configuration
Customize `spec/support/jasmine.json` to enumerate the source and spec files you would like the Jasmine runner to include.
You may use dir glob strings.
More information on the format of `jasmine.json` can be found in [the documentation](http://jasmine.github.io/edge/node.html#section-Configuration)
Alternatively, you may specify the path to your `jasmine.json` by setting an environment variable or an option:
```shell
jasmine JASMINE_CONFIG_PATH=relative/path/to/your/jasmine.json
jasmine --config=relative/path/to/your/jasmine.json
```
# Filtering specs
Execute only those specs which filename match given glob:
```shell
jasmine "spec/**/critical/*Spec.js"
```
Or a single file:
```shell
jasmine spec/currentSpec.js
```
Or execute only those specs which name matches a particular regex:
```shell
jasmine --filter "adapter21*"
```
(where the *name* of a spec is the first parameter passed to `describe()`)

# jison-lex
A lexical analyzer generator used by [jison](http://jison.org). It takes a lexical grammar definition (either in JSON or Bison's lexical grammar format) and outputs a JavaScript lexer.
## install
npm install jison-lex -g
## usage
```
Usage: jison-lex [file] [options]
file     file containing a lexical grammar
Options:
   -o FILE, --outfile FILE       Filename and base module name of the generated parser
   -t TYPE, --module-type TYPE   The type of module to generate (commonjs, js)
   --version                     print version and exit
```
## programatic usage
```
var JisonLex = require('jison-lex');
var grammar = {
  rules: [
    ["x", "return 'X';" ],
    ["y", "return 'Y';" ],
    ["$", "return 'EOF';" ]
  ]
};
// or load from a file
// var grammar = fs.readFileSync('mylexer.l', 'utf8');
// generate source
var lexerSource = JisonLex.generate(grammar);
// or create a parser in memory
var lexer = new JisonLex(grammar);
lexer.setInput('xyxxy');
lexer.lex();
// => 'X'
lexer.lex();
// => 'Y'

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/zaach/jison.png)](http://travis-ci.org/zaach/jison)
An API for creating parsers in JavaScript
-----------------------------------------
Jison generates bottom-up parsers in JavaScript. Its API is similar to Bison's, hence the name. It supports many of Bison's major features, plus some of its own. If you are new to parser generators such as Bison, and Context-free Grammars in general, a [good introduction][1] is found in the Bison manual. If you already know Bison, Jison should be easy to pickup.
Briefly, Jison takes a JSON encoded grammar or Bison style grammar and outputs a JavaScript file capable of parsing the language described by that grammar. You can then use the generated script to parse inputs and accept, reject, or perform actions based on the input.
Installation
------------
Jison can be installed for [Node](http://nodejs.org) using [`npm`](http://github.com/isaacs/npm/)
Using npm:
    npm install jison -g
Usage from the command line
-----------------------
Clone the github repository for examples:
    git clone git://github.com/zaach/jison.git
    cd jison/examples
Now you're ready to generate some parsers:
    jison calculator.jison
This will generate `calculator.js` in your current working directory. This file can be used to parse an input file, like so:
    echo "2^32 / 1024" > testcalc
    node calculator.js testcalc
This will print out `4194304`.
Full cli option list:
    Usage: jison [file] [lexfile] [options]
    file        file containing a grammar
    lexfile     file containing a lexical grammar
    Options:
       -j, --json                    force jison to expect a grammar in JSON format
       -o FILE, --outfile FILE       Filename and base module name of the generated parser
       -t, --debug                   Debug mode
       -m TYPE, --module-type TYPE   The type of module to generate (commonjs, amd, js)
       -p TYPE, --parser-type TYPE   The type of algorithm to use for the parser (lr0, slr, lalr, lr)
       -V, --version                 print version and exit
Usage from a CommonJS module
--------------------------
You can generate parsers programatically from JavaScript as well. Assuming Jison is in your commonjs environment's load path:
```javascript
// mygenerator.js
var Parser = require("jison").Parser;
// a grammar in JSON
var grammar = {
    "lex": {
        "rules": [
           ["\\s+", "/* skip whitespace */"],
           ["[a-f0-9]+", "return 'HEX';"]
        ]
    },
    "bnf": {
        "hex_strings" :[ "hex_strings HEX",
         "HEX" ]
    }
};
// `grammar` can also be a string that uses jison's grammar format
var parser = new Parser(grammar);
// generate source, ready to be written to disk
var parserSource = parser.generate();
// you can also use the parser directly from memory
// returns true
parser.parse("adfe34bc e82a");
// throws lexical error
parser.parse("adfe34bc zxg");
```

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/jasmine/jasmine-ajax/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jasmine/jasmine-ajax)
If you are using the updated version of this library, there is some additional documentation located at [jasmine.github.io](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/mocking_ajax) that is up-to-date.
jasmine-ajax - Faking Ajax responses in your Jasmine suite.
============
jasmine-ajax is a library that lets you define a set of fake responses for Ajax
requests made by your application, specify per spec which response should be
used, and keep track of the Ajax requests you make so you can make assertions
about the results.

When submitting a pull request, run `grunt build` and commit the changes to the generated file `lib/mock-ajax.js` in order for the build's automated tests to pass.
Libraries Supported
-------------------
jasmine-ajax is currently compatible with any library that uses XMLHttpRequest.
Installing
----------
#### NPM ####
Install `jasmine-ajax` from NPM via  `npm install --save-dev jasmine-ajax`; you can then `require('jasmine-ajax')` inside your test-suite and access it via the `jasmine` global.
#### Browser ####
Download [mock-ajax.js](https://raw.github.com/jasmine/jasmine-ajax/master/lib/mock-ajax.js) and add it to your project. If you are using the jasmine gem, be sure the location you put mock-ajax.js is included in your `helpers` path in jasmine.yml. If you are using Jasmine standalone, make sure you add it to your spec runner.
Setup
-----
Using the library in your Jasmine specs consists of five parts:
1. Defining test responses
2. Installing the mock
3. Triggering the ajax request code
3. Defining the response for each request
4. Inspecting Ajax requests and setting expectations on them
Example
-------
Let's use a simple Foursquare venue search app to show each of these steps.
### 1. Defining Test Responses ###
After signing up for an API key and playing around with curl a bit you should have an idea of what API resources you are interested in and what sample responses look like. Once you do, you can define simple JavaScripts objects that will be used to build XMLHttpRequest objects later.
For example, if you have a response that looks like this:
```json
{
    "meta":{
        "code":200,
        "errorType":"deprecated",
        "errorDetail":"This endpoint will stop returning groups in the future. Please use a current version, see http://bit.ly/lZx3NU."
    },
    "response":{
        "groups":[{
"type":"nearby",
"name":"Nearby",
"items":[{
        "id":"4bb9fd9f3db7b7138dbd229a",
        "name":"Pivotal Labs",
        "contact":{
            "twitter":"pivotalboulder"
        },
        "location":{
            "address":"1701 Pearl St.",
            "crossStreet":"at 17th St.",
            "city":"Boulder",
            "state":"CO",
            "lat":40.019461,
            "lng":-105.273296,
            "distance":0
        },
        "categories":[{
                "id":"4bf58dd8d48988d124941735",
                "name":"Office",
                "pluralName":"Offices",
                "icon":"https://foursquare.com/img/categories/building/default.png",
                "parents":["Homes, Work, Others"
                ],
                "primary":true
            }
        ],
        "verified":false,
        "stats":{
            "checkinsCount":223,
            "usersCount":62
        },
        "hereNow":{
            "count":0
        }
    }
]
}
        ]
    }
}
```
Then you'd define a mock response that looks something like this:
```javascript
var TestResponses = {
  search: {
    success: {
      status: 200,
      responseText: '{"response":{"groups":[{"type":"nearby","name":"Nearby","items":[{"id":"4bb9fd9f3db7b7138dbd229a","name":"Pivotal Labs","contact":{"twitter":"pivotalboulder"},"location":{"address":"1701 Pearl St.","crossStreet":"at 17th St.","city":"Boulder","state":"CO","lat":40.019461,"lng":-105.273296,"distance":0},"categories":[{"id":"4bf58dd8d48988d124941735","name":"Office","pluralName":"Offices","icon":"https://foursquare.com/img/categories/building/default.png","parents":["Homes, Work, Others"],"primary":true}],"verified":false,"stats":{"checkinsCount":223,"usersCount":62},"hereNow":{"count":0}},{"id":"4af2eccbf964a5203ae921e3","name":"Laughing Goat Café","contact":{},"location":{"address":"1709 Pearl St.","crossStreet":"btw 16th & 17th","city":"Boulder","state":"CO","postalCode":"80302","country":"USA","lat":40.019321,"lng":-105.27311982,"distance":21},"categories":[{"id":"4bf58dd8d48988d1e0931735","name":"Coffee Shop","pluralName":"Coffee Shops","icon":"https://foursquare.com/img/categories/food/coffeeshop.png","parents":["Food"],"primary":true},{"id":"4bf58dd8d48988d1a7941735","name":"College Library","pluralName":"College Libraries","icon":"https://foursquare.com/img/categories/education/default.png","parents":["Colleges & Universities"]}],"verified":false,"stats":{"checkinsCount":1314,"usersCount":517},"hereNow":{"count":0}},{"id":"4ca777a597c8a1cdf7bc7aa5","name":"Ted\'s Montana Grill","contact":{"phone":"3034495546","formattedPhone":"(303) 449-5546","twitter":"TedMontanaGrill"},"location":{"address":"1701 Pearl St.","crossStreet":"17th and Pearl","city":"Boulder","state":"CO","postalCode":"80302","country":"USA","lat":40.019376,"lng":-105.273311,"distance":9},"categories":[{"id":"4bf58dd8d48988d1cc941735","name":"Steakhouse","pluralName":"Steakhouses","icon":"https://foursquare.com/img/categories/food/steakhouse.png","parents":["Food"],"primary":true}],"verified":true,"stats":{"checkinsCount":197,"usersCount":150},"url":"http://www.tedsmontanagrill.com/","hereNow":{"count":0}},{"id":"4d3cac5a8edf3704e894b2a5","name":"Pizzeria Locale","contact":{},"location":{"address":"1730 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","state":"CO","postalCode":"80302","country":"USA","lat":40.0193746,"lng":-105.2726744,"distance":53},"categories":[{"id":"4bf58dd8d48988d1ca941735","name":"Pizza Place","pluralName":"Pizza Places","icon":"https://foursquare.com/img/categories/food/pizza.png","parents":["Food"],"primary":true}],"verified":false,"stats":{"checkinsCount":511,"usersCount":338},"hereNow":{"count":2}},{"id":"4d012cd17c56370462a6b4f0","name":"The Pinyon","contact":{},"location":{"address":"1710 Pearl St.","city":"Boulder","state":"CO","country":"USA","lat":40.019219,"lng":-105.2730563,"distance":33},"categories":[{"id":"4bf58dd8d48988d14e941735","name":"American Restaurant","pluralName":"American Restaurants","icon":"https://foursquare.com/img/categories/food/default.png","parents":["Food"],"primary":true}],"verified":true,"stats":{"checkinsCount":163,"usersCount":98},"hereNow":{"count":1}}]}]}}'
    }
  }
};
```
A good place to define this is in `spec/javascripts/helpers/test_responses`. You can also define failure responses, for whatever status codes the API you are working with supports.
### 2. Installing the mock ###
Install the mock using `jasmine.Ajax.install()`:
```javascript
beforeEach(function() {
  jasmine.Ajax.install();
  ...
});
// don't forget to uninstall as well...
afterEach(function() {
  jasmine.Ajax.uninstall();
  ...
});
```
After this, all Ajax requests will be captured by jasmine-ajax. If you want to do things like load fixtures, do it before you install the mock (see below).
### 3. Trigger ajax request code ###
Before you can specify that a request uses your test response, you must have a handle to the request itself.  This means that the request is made first by the code under test and then you will set your test response (see next step).
```javascript
foursquare.search('40.019461,-105.273296', {
  onSuccess: onSuccess,
  onFailure: onFailure
});
request = jasmine.Ajax.requests.mostRecent();
```
The onreadystatechange event isn't fired to complete the ajax request until you set the response in the next step.
### 4. Set responses ###
Now that you've defined some test responses and installed the mock, you need to tell jasmine-ajax which response to use for a given spec. If you want to use your success response for a set of related success specs, you might use:
```javascript
describe("on success", function() {
  beforeEach(function() {
    request.respondWith(TestResponses.search.success);
  });
});
```
Now for all the specs in this example group, whenever an Ajax response is sent, it will use the `TestResponses.search.success` object defined in your test responses to build the XMLHttpRequest object.
### 5. Inspect Ajax requests ###
Putting it all together, you can install the mock, pass some spies as callbacks to your search object, and make expectations about the expected behavior.
```javascript
describe("FoursquareVenueSearch", function() {
  var foursquare, request;
  var onSuccess, onFailure;
  beforeEach(function() {
    jasmine.Ajax.install();
    onSuccess = jasmine.createSpy('onSuccess');
    onFailure = jasmine.createSpy('onFailure');
    foursquare = new FoursquareVenueSearch();
    foursquare.search('40.019461,-105.273296', {
      onSuccess: onSuccess,
      onFailure: onFailure
    });
    request = jasmine.Ajax.requests.mostRecent();
    expect(request.url).toBe('venues/search');
    expect(request.method).toBe('POST');
    expect(request.data()).toEqual({latLng: ['40.019461, -105.273296']});
  });
  describe("on success", function() {
    beforeEach(function() {
      request.respondWith(TestResponses.search.success);
    });
    it("calls onSuccess with an array of Locations", function() {
      expect(onSuccess).toHaveBeenCalled();
      var successArgs = onSuccess.calls.mostRecent().args[0];
      expect(successArgs.length).toEqual(1);
      expect(successArgs[0]).toEqual(jasmine.any(Venue));
    });
  });
});
```
By default the `data` function is very naive about parsing form data being sent.
The provided parsers are:
1. If the XHR has a content-type of application/json, JSON.parse
1. Otherwise simply split query string by '&' and '='
If you need more control over how your data is presented, you can supply a custom param parser. Custom parsers will be prepended to the list of parsers to try.
```javascript
describe("custom params", function() {
  beforeEach(function() {
    jasmine.Ajax.install();
    jasmine.Ajax.addCustomParamParser({
      test: function(xhr) {
        // return true if you can parse
      },
      parse: function(params) {
        // parse and return
      }
    });
  });
});
```
Loading Fixtures
----------------
Most third-party Jasmine extensions use Ajax to load HTML fixtures into the DOM. Since jasmine-ajax intercepts all Ajax calls after it is installed, you need to load your fixtures before installing the mock. If you are using jasmine-jquery, that looks like this:
```javascript
beforeEach(function(){
  // first load your fixtures
  loadFixtures('fixture.html');
  // then install the mock
  jasmine.Ajax.install();
});
```
Complex Requests
----------------
Third-party frameworks may do many requests you can not simply respond to.
Let's assume that you are talking to a SOAP service. SOAP services mostly have identical URL's, but responses differ by the XML request that was send using a POST request.
Let's register a response that will be used if the request body was matched against a RegExp.
```javascript
beforeEach(function(){
  // first install the mock
  jasmine.Ajax.install();
  // then register a request to which automatically will be responded
  jasmine.Ajax.stubRequest(
    'https://soap.domain.tld/ws/UserManager',
    /.*\<registrationRequest\>.*/
  ).andReturn({
    status: 200,
    statusText: 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK',
    contentType: 'text/xml;charset=UTF-8',
    responseText: '<soap:Envelope><soap:Body><registrationResponse><username>foo</username><password>bar</password></registrationResponse></soap:Body></soap:Envelope>'
  });
  // Register another response for the same URL, but with different SOAP request
  jasmine.Ajax.stubRequest(
    'https://soap.domain.tld/ws/UserManager',
    /.*\<loginRequest\>.*/
  ).andReturn({
    status: 200,
    statusText: 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK',
    contentType: 'text/xml;charset=UTF-8',
    responseText: '<soap:Envelope><soap:Body><loginResponse><success>true</success></loginResponse></soap:Body></soap:Envelope>'
  });
});
```
Or if you also want to avoid the host part of the URL, you can register it using a RegExp for the URL, too.
```javascript
beforeEach(function(){
  // first install the mock
  jasmine.Ajax.install();
  // then register a request to which automatically will be responded
  jasmine.Ajax.stubRequest(
    /.*\/ws\/UserManager/,
    /.*\<registrationRequest\>.*/
  ).andReturn({
    status: 200,
    statusText: 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK',
    contentType: 'text/xml;charset=UTF-8',
    responseText: '<soap:Envelope><soap:Body><registrationResponse><username>foo</username><password>bar</password></registrationResponse></soap:Body></soap:Envelope>'
  });
});
```

           Version 2.0, January 2004
        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   1. Definitions.
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Natural Compare &ndash; [![Build][]][1] [![Coverage][]][2]
===============
Compare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers
in the way a human being would in sort order.
This is described as a "natural ordering".
```text
Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:
    img1.png            img1.png
    img10.png           img2.png
    img12.png           img10.png
    img2.png            img12.png
```
String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating
whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same
as the given string in sort order.
Use it with builtin sort() function.
### Installation
- In browser
```html
<script src=min.natural-compare.js></script>
```
- In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`
```javascript
require("natural-compare-lite")
```
### Usage
```javascript
// Simple case sensitive example
var a = ["z1.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z2.doc", "z23.doc", "z3.doc"];
a.sort(String.naturalCompare);
// ["z1.doc", "z2.doc", "z3.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z23.doc"]
// Use wrapper function for case insensitivity
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase());
})
// In most cases we want to sort an array of objects
var a = [ {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-1021"}
        , {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-21046-b"} ];
// sort by street, then by room
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room);
})
// When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()),
// it is best for performance to keep
// transformed key in that object.
// There are no need to do text transformation
// on each comparision when sorting.
var a = [ {"make":"Audi", "model":"A6"}
        , {"make":"Kia",  "model":"Rio"} ];
// sort by make, then by model
a.map(function(car){
  car.sort_key = (car.make + " " + car.model).toLowerCase();
})
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key);
})
```
- Works well with dates in ISO format eg "Rev 2012-07-26.doc".
### Custom alphabet
It is possible to configure a custom alphabet
to achieve a desired order.
```javascript
// Estonian alphabet
String.alphabet = "ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSŠZŽTUVÕÄÖÜXYabdefghijklmnoprsšzžtuvõäöüxy"
["t", "z", "x", "õ"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// ["z", "t", "õ", "x"]
// Russian alphabet
String.alphabet = "АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя"
["Ё", "А", "Б"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// ["А", "Б", "Ё"]
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.
The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.
If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.
You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.
If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
          Preamble
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
          NO WARRANTY
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Forge project.
If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.
You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.
If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
          Preamble
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made

impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of

make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
          NO WARRANTY
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

# nodemon
nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
nodemon does **not** require *any* additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for `node`, to use `nodemon` replace the word `node` on the command line when executing your script.
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/nodemon.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/nodemon)
[![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/remy/nodemon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/remy/nodemon) [![Backers on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nodemon/backers/badge.svg)](#backers) [![Sponsors on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nodemon/sponsors/badge.svg)](#sponsors)
# Installation
Either through cloning with git or by using [npm](http://npmjs.org) (the recommended way):
```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```
And nodemon will be installed globally to your system path.
You can also install nodemon as a development dependency:
```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```
With a local installation, nodemon will not be available in your system path. Instead, the local installation of nodemon can be run by calling it from within an npm script (such as `npm start`) or using `npx nodemon`.
# Usage
nodemon wraps your application, so you can pass all the arguments you would normally pass to your app:
```bash
nodemon [your node app]
```
For CLI options, use the `-h` (or `--help`) argument:
```bash
nodemon -h
```
Using nodemon is simple, if my application accepted a host and port as the arguments, I would start it as so:
```bash
nodemon ./server.js localhost 8080
```
Any output from this script is prefixed with `[nodemon]`, otherwise all output from your application, errors included, will be echoed out as expected.
If no script is given, nodemon will test for a `package.json` file and if found, will run the file associated with the *main* property ([ref](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/14)).
You can also pass the `inspect` flag to node through the command line as you would normally:
```bash
nodemon --inspect ./server.js 80
```
If you have a `package.json` file for your app, you can omit the main script entirely and nodemon will read the `package.json` for the `main` property and use that value as the app.
nodemon will also search for the `scripts.start` property in `package.json` (as of nodemon 1.1.x).

nodemon was originally written to restart hanging processes such as web servers, but now supports apps that cleanly exit. If your script exits cleanly, nodemon will continue to monitor the directory (or directories) and restart the script if there are any changes.
## Manual restarting
Whilst nodemon is running, if you need to manually restart your application, instead of stopping and restart nodemon, you can type `rs` with a carriage return, and nodemon will restart your process.
## Config files
nodemon supports local and global configuration files. These are usually named `nodemon.json` and can be located in the current working directory or in your home directory. An alternative local configuration file can be specified with the `--config <file>` option.
The specificity is as follows, so that a command line argument will always override the config file settings:
- command line arguments
- local config
- global config
A config file can take any of the command line arguments as JSON key values, for example:
```json
{
  "verbose": true,
  "ignore": ["*.test.js", "fixtures/*"],
  "execMap": {
    "rb": "ruby",
    "pde": "processing --sketch={{pwd}} --run"
  }
}
```
The above `nodemon.json` file might be my global config so that I have support for ruby files and processing files, and I can run `nodemon demo.pde` and nodemon will automatically know how to run the script even though out of the box support for processing scripts.
A further example of options can be seen in [sample-nodemon.md](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/sample-nodemon.md)
### package.json
If you want to keep all your package configurations in one place, nodemon supports using `package.json` for configuration.
Specify the config in the same format as you would for a config file but under `nodemonConfig` in the `package.json` file, for example, take the following `package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "nodemon",
  "homepage": "http://nodemon.io",
  "...": "... other standard package.json values",
  "nodemonConfig": {
    "ignore": ["test/*", "docs/*"],
    "delay": "2500"
  }
}
```
Note that if you specify a `--config` file or provide a local `nodemon.json` any `package.json` config is ignored.
*This section needs better documentation, but for now you can also see `nodemon --help config` ([also here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/cli/config.txt))*.
## Using nodemon as a module
Please see [doc/requireable.md](doc/requireable.md)
## Using nodemon as child process
Please see [doc/events.md](doc/events.md#Using_nodemon_as_child_process)
## Running non-node scripts
nodemon can also be used to execute and monitor other programs. nodemon will read the file extension of the script being run and monitor that extension instead of `.js` if there's no `nodemon.json`:
```bash
nodemon --exec "python -v" ./app.py
```
Now nodemon will run `app.py` with python in verbose mode (note that if you're not passing args to the exec program, you don't need the quotes), and look for new or modified files with the `.py` extension.
### Default executables
Using the `nodemon.json` config file, you can define your own default executables using the `execMap` property. This is particularly useful if you're working with a language that isn't supported by default by nodemon.
To add support for nodemon to know about the `.pl` extension (for Perl), the `nodemon.json` file would add:
```json
{
  "execMap": {
    "pl": "perl"
  }
}
```
Now running the following, nodemon will know to use `perl` as the executable:
```bash
nodemon script.pl
```
It's generally recommended to use the global `nodemon.json` to add your own `execMap` options. However, if there's a common default that's missing, this can be merged in to the project so that nodemon supports it by default, by changing [default.js](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/lib/config/defaults.js) and sending a pull request.
## Monitoring multiple directories
By default nodemon monitors the current working directory. If you want to take control of that option, use the `--watch` option to add specific paths:
```bash
nodemon --watch app --watch libs app/server.js
```
Now nodemon will only restart if there are changes in the `./app` or `./libs` directory. By default nodemon will traverse sub-directories, so there's no need in explicitly including sub-directories.
Don't use unix globbing to pass multiple directories, e.g `--watch ./lib/*`, it won't work. You need a `--watch` flag per directory watched.
## Specifying extension watch list
By default, nodemon looks for files with the `.js`, `.mjs`, `.coffee`, `.litcoffee`, and `.json` extensions. If you use the `--exec` option and monitor `app.py` nodemon will monitor files with the extension of `.py`. However, you can specify your own list with the `-e` (or `--ext`) switch like so:
```bash
nodemon -e js,pug
```
Now nodemon will restart on any changes to files in the directory (or subdirectories) with the extensions `.js`, `.pug`.
## Ignoring files
By default, nodemon will only restart when a `.js` JavaScript file changes. In some cases you will want to ignore some specific files, directories or file patterns, to prevent nodemon from prematurely restarting your application.
This can be done via the command line:
```bash
nodemon --ignore lib/ --ignore tests/
```
Or specific files can be ignored:
```bash
nodemon --ignore lib/app.js
```
Patterns can also be ignored (but be sure to quote the arguments):
```bash
nodemon --ignore 'lib/*.js'
```
Note that by default, nodemon will ignore the `.git`, `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `.nyc_output`, `coverage` and `.sass-cache` directories and *add* your ignored patterns to the list. If you want to indeed watch a directory like `node_modules`, you need to [override the underlying default ignore rules](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md#overriding-the-underlying-default-ignore-rules).
## Application isn't restarting
In some networked environments (such as a container running nodemon reading across a mounted drive), you will need to use the `legacyWatch: true` which enables Chokidar's polling.
Via the CLI, use either `--legacy-watch` or `-L` for short:
```bash
nodemon -L
```
Though this should be a last resort as it will poll every file it can find.
## Delaying restarting
In some situations, you may want to wait until a number of files have changed. The timeout before checking for new file changes is 1 second. If you're uploading a number of files and it's taking some number of seconds, this could cause your app to restart multiple times unnecessarily.
To add an extra throttle, or delay restarting, use the `--delay` command:
```bash
nodemon --delay 10 server.js
```
For more precision, milliseconds can be specified.  Either as a float:
```bash
nodemon --delay 2.5 server.js
```
Or using the time specifier (ms):
```bash
nodemon --delay 2500ms server.js
```
The delay figure is number of seconds (or milliseconds, if specified) to delay before restarting. So nodemon will only restart your app the given number of seconds after the *last* file change.
If you are setting this value in `nodemon.json`, the value will always be interpreted in milliseconds. E.g., the following are equivalent:
```bash
nodemon --delay 2.5
{
  "delay": "2500"
}
```
## Gracefully reloading down your script
It is possible to have nodemon send any signal that you specify to your application.
```bash
nodemon --signal SIGHUP server.js
```
Your application can handle the signal as follows.
```js
process.once("SIGHUP", function () {
  reloadSomeConfiguration();
})
```
Please note that nodemon will send this signal to every process in the process tree.
If you are using `cluster`, then each workers (as well as the master) will receive the signal. If you wish to terminate all workers on receiving a `SIGHUP`, a common pattern is to catch the `SIGHUP` in the master, and forward `SIGTERM` to all workers, while ensuring that all workers ignore `SIGHUP`.
```js
if (cluster.isMaster) {
  process.on("SIGHUP", function () {
    for (const worker of Object.values(cluster.workers)) {
      worker.process.kill("SIGTERM");
    }
  });
} else {
  process.on("SIGHUP", function() {})
}
```
## Controlling shutdown of your script
nodemon sends a kill signal to your application when it sees a file update. If you need to clean up on shutdown inside your script you can capture the kill signal and handle it yourself.
The following example will listen once for the `SIGUSR2` signal (used by nodemon to restart), run the clean up process and then kill itself for nodemon to continue control:
```js
process.once('SIGUSR2', function () {
  gracefulShutdown(function () {
    process.kill(process.pid, 'SIGUSR2');
  });
});
```
Note that the `process.kill` is *only* called once your shutdown jobs are complete. Hat tip to [Benjie Gillam](http://www.benjiegillam.com/2011/08/node-js-clean-restart-and-faster-development-with-nodemon/) for writing this technique up.
## Triggering events when nodemon state changes
If you want growl like notifications when nodemon restarts or to trigger an action when an event happens, then you can either `require` nodemon or add event actions to your `nodemon.json` file.
For example, to trigger a notification on a Mac when nodemon restarts, `nodemon.json` looks like this:
```json
{
  "events": {
    "restart": "osascript -e 'display notification \"app restarted\" with title \"nodemon\"'"
  }
}
```
A full list of available events is listed on the [event states wiki](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/wiki/Events#states). Note that you can bind to both states and messages.
## Pipe output to somewhere else
```js
nodemon({
  script: ...,
  stdout: false // important: this tells nodemon not to output to console
}).on('readable', function() { // the `readable` event indicates that data is ready to pick up
  this.stdout.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'));
  this.stderr.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('err.txt'));
});
```

## Pronunciation
> nodemon, is it pronounced: node-mon, no-demon or node-e-mon (like pokémon)?
Well...I've been asked this many times before. I like that I've been asked this before. There's been bets as to which one it actually is.
The answer is simple, but possibly frustrating. I'm not saying (how I pronounce it). It's up to you to call it as you like. All answers are correct :)
## Design principles
- Fewer flags is better
- Works across all platforms
- Fewer features
- Let individuals build on top of nodemon
- Offer all CLI functionality as an API
- Contributions must have and pass tests
Nodemon is not perfect, and CLI arguments has sprawled beyond where I'm completely happy, but perhaps it can be reduced a little one day.

nomnom@1.5.2  Custom: http://nodejs.org/  https://github.com/harthur/nomnom/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# deprecation notice
Nomnom is deprecated. Check out https://github.com/tj/commander.js, which should have most, if not all of the capability that nomnom had. Thank you!
# nomnom
nomnom is an option parser for node. It noms your args and gives them back to you in a hash.
```javascript
var opts = require("nomnom")
   .option('debug', {
      abbr: 'd',
      flag: true,
      help: 'Print debugging info'
   })
   .option('config', {
      abbr: 'c',
      default: 'config.json',
      help: 'JSON file with tests to run'
   })
   .option('version', {
      flag: true,
      help: 'print version and exit',
      callback: function() {
         return "version 1.2.4";
      }
   })
   .parse();
if (opts.debug)
   // do stuff
```
You don't have to specify anything if you don't want to:
```javascript
var opts = require("nomnom").parse();
var url = opts[0];     // get the first positional arg
var file = opts.file   // see if --file was specified
var verbose = opts.v   // see if -v was specified
var extras = opts._    // get an array of the unmatched, positional args
```
# Install
for [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):
	npm install nomnom
# More Details
Nomnom supports args like `-d`, `--debug`, `--no-debug`, `--file=test.txt`, `--file test.txt`, `-f test.txt`, `-xvf`, and positionals. Positionals are arguments that don't fit the `-a` or `--atomic` format and aren't attached to an option.
Values are JSON parsed, so `--debug=true --count=3 --file=log.txt` would give you:
```
{
   "debug": true,
   "count": 3,
   "file": "log.txt"
}
```
# Commands
Nomnom supports command-based interfaces (e.g. with git: `git add -p` and `git rebase -i` where `add` and `rebase` are the commands):
```javascript
var parser = require("nomnom");
parser.command('browser')
   .callback(function(opts) {
      runBrowser(opts.url);
   })
   .help("run browser tests");
parser.command('sanity')
   .option('outfile', {
      abbr: 'o',
      help: "file to write results to"
   })
   .option('config', {
      abbr: 'c',
      default: 'config.json',
      help: "json manifest of tests to run"
   })
   .callback(function(opts) {
      runSanity(opts.filename);
   })
   .help("run the sanity tests")
parser.parse();
```
Each command generates its own usage message when `-h` or `--help` is specified with the command.
# Usage
Nomnom prints out a usage message if `--help` or `-h` is an argument. Usage for these options in `test.js`:
```javascript
var opts = require("nomnom")
   .script("runtests")
   .options({
      path: {
         position: 0,
         help: "Test file to run",
         list: true
      },
      config: {
         abbr: 'c',
         metavar: 'FILE',
         help: "Config file with tests to run"
      },
      debug: {
         abbr: 'd',
         flag: true,
         help: "Print debugging info"
      }
   }).parse();
```
...would look like this:
	usage: runtests <path>... [options]
	path     Test file to run
	options:
	   -c FILE, --config FILE   Config file with tests to run
	   -d, --debug              Print debugging info
# Options
You can either add a specification for an option with `nomnom.option('name', spec)` or pass the specifications to `nomnom.options()` as a hash keyed on option name. Each option specification can have the following fields:
#### abbr and full
`abbr` is the single character string to match to this option, `full` is the full-length string (defaults to the name of the option).
This option matches `-d` and `--debug` on the command line:
```javascript
nomnom.option('debug', {
   abbr: 'd'
})
```
This option matches `-n 3`, `--num-lines 12` on the command line:
```javascript
nomnom.option('numLines', {
   abbr: 'n',
   full: 'num-lines'
})
```
#### flag
If this is set to true, the option acts as a flag and doesn't swallow the next value on the command line. Default is `false`, so normally if you had a command line `--config test.js`, `config` would get a value of `test.js` in the options hash. Whereas if you specify:
```javascript
nomnom.option('config', {
   flag: true
})
```
`config` would get a value of `true` in the options hash, and `test.js` would be a free positional arg.
#### metavar
`metavar` is used in the usage printout e.g. `"PATH"` in `"-f PATH, --file PATH"`.
#### string
A shorthand for `abbr`, `full`, and `metavar`. For example, to attach an option to `-c` and `--config` use a `string: "-c FILE, --config=FILE"`
#### help
A string description of the option for the usage printout.
#### default
The value to give the option if it's not specified in the arguments.
#### type
If you don't want the option JSON-parsed, specify type `"string"`.
#### callback
A callback that will be executed as soon as the option is encountered. If the callback returns a string it will print the string and exit:
```javascript
nomnom.option('count', {
   callback: function(count) {
      if (count != parseInt(count)) {
         return "count must be an integer";
      }
   }
})
```
#### position
The position of the option if it's a positional argument. If the option should be matched to the first positional arg use position `0`, etc.
#### list
Specifies that the option is a list. Appending can be achieved by specifying the arg more than once on the command line:
	node test.js --file=test1.js --file=test2.js
If the option has a `position` and `list` is `true`, all positional args including and after `position` will be appended to the array.
#### required
If this is set to `true` and the option isn't in the args, a message will be printed and the program will exit.
#### choices
A list of the possible values for the option (e.g. `['run', 'test', 'open']`). If the parsed value isn't in the list a message will be printed and the program will exit.
#### transform
A function that takes the value of the option as entered and returns a new value that will be seen as the value of the option.
```javascript
nomnom.option('date', {
   abbr: 'd',
   transform: function(timestamp) {
     return new Date(timestamp);
   }
})
```
#### hidden
Option won't be printed in the usage
# Parser interface
`require("nomnom")` will give you the option parser. You can also make an instance of a parser with `require("nomnom")()`. You can chain any of these functions off of a parser:
#### option
Add an option specification with the given name:
```javascript
nomnom.option('debug', {
   abbr: 'd',
   flag: true,
   help: "Print debugging info"
})
```
#### options
Add options as a hash keyed by option name, good for a cli with tons of options like [this example](http://github.com/harthur/replace/blob/master/bin/replace.js):
```javascript
nomnom.options({
   debug: {
      abbr: 'd',
      flag: true,
      help: "Print debugging info"
   },
   fruit: {
      help: "Fruit to buy"
   }
})
```
#### usage
The string that will override the default generated usage message.
#### help
A string that is appended to the usage.
#### script
Nomnom can't detect the alias used to run your script. You can use `script` to provide the correct name for the usage printout instead of e.g. `node test.js`.
#### printer
Overrides the usage printing function.
#### command
Takes a command name and gives you a command object on which you can chain command options.
#### nocommand
Gives a command object that will be used when no command is called.
#### nocolors
Disables coloring of the usage message.
#### parse
Parses node's `process.argv` and returns the parsed options hash. You can also provide argv:
```javascript
var opts = nomnom.parse(["-xvf", "--atomic=true"])
```
#### nom
The same as `parse()`.
# Command interface
A command is specified with `nomnom.command('name')`. All these functions can be chained on a command:
#### option
Add an option specifically for this command.
#### options
Add options for this command as a hash of options keyed by name.
#### callback
A callback that will be called with the parsed options when the command is used.
#### help
A help string describing the function of this command.
#### usage
Override the default generated usage string for this command.

"Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.
"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.
"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

optjs@3.2.2  MIT  https://github.com/dcodeIO/opt.js/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
![opt.js](https://raw.github.com/dcodeIO/opt.js/master/opt.png)
======
Probably the sole command line option parser you'll ever need to <del>`npm install optjs`</del> Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V. Proof:
```js
function opt(argv) {
    var opt={},arg,p;argv=Array.prototype.slice.call(argv||process.argv);for(var i=2;i<argv.length;i++)if(argv[i].charAt(0)=='-')
    ((p=(arg=(""+argv.splice(i--,1)).replace(/^[\-]+/,'')).indexOf("="))>0?opt[arg.substring(0,p)]=arg.substring(p+1):opt[arg]=true);
    return {'node':argv[0],'script':argv[1],'argv':argv.slice(2),'opt':opt};
}
```
Usage
-----
```js
var opt = require("optjs")();
console.log(opt.node);   // Path to node executable
console.log(opt.script); // Path to the current script
console.log(opt.opt);    // Command line options as a hash
console.log(opt.argv);   // Remaining non-option arguments
```
Example
-------
`node somescript.js foo -a=1 -b --c="hello world" bar ----d`
```js
// Result
opt.node   == "/path/to/node[.exe]"
opt.script == "/path/to/somescript.js"
opt.opt    == { a: 1, b: true, c: "hello world", d: true }
opt.argv   == ["foo", "bar"]
```
Full-featured test suite
------------------------
```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log(require("./opt.js")());
```

proxy-from-env@1.0.0  MIT  https://github.com/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# proxy-from-env
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rob--W/proxy-from-env.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rob--W/proxy-from-env)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Rob--W/proxy-from-env?branch=master)
`proxy-from-env` is a Node.js package that exports a function (`getProxyForUrl`)
that takes an input URL (a string or
[`url.parse`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/url.html#url_url_parsing)'s
return value) and returns the desired proxy URL (also a string) based on
standard proxy environment variables. If no proxy is set, an empty string is
returned.
It is your responsibility to actually proxy the request using the given URL.
Installation:
```sh
npm install proxy-from-env
```
## Example
This example shows how the data for a URL can be fetched via the
[`http` module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html), in a proxy-aware way.
```javascript
var http = require('http');
var parseUrl = require('url').parse;
var getProxyForUrl = require('proxy-from-env').getProxyForUrl;
var some_url = 'http://example.com/something';
// // Example, if there is a proxy server at 10.0.0.1:1234, then setting the
// // http_proxy environment variable causes the request to go through a proxy.
// process.env.http_proxy = 'http://10.0.0.1:1234';
// 
// // But if the host to be proxied is listed in NO_PROXY, then the request is
// // not proxied (but a direct request is made).
// process.env.no_proxy = 'example.com';
var proxy_url = getProxyForUrl(some_url);  // <-- Our magic.
if (proxy_url) {
  // Should be proxied through proxy_url.
  var parsed_some_url = parseUrl(some_url);
  var parsed_proxy_url = parseUrl(proxy_url);
  // A HTTP proxy is quite simple. It is similar to a normal request, except the
  // path is an absolute URL, and the proxied URL's host is put in the header
  // instead of the server's actual host.
  httpOptions = {
    protocol: parsed_proxy_url.protocol,
    hostname: parsed_proxy_url.hostname,
    port: parsed_proxy_url.port,
    path: parsed_some_url.href,
    headers: {
      Host: parsed_some_url.host,  // = host name + optional port.
    },
  };
} else {
  // Direct request.
  httpOptions = some_url;
}
http.get(httpOptions, function(res) {
  var responses = [];
  res.on('data', function(chunk) { responses.push(chunk); });
  res.on('end', function() { console.log(responses.join(''));  });
});
```
## Environment variables
The environment variables can be specified in lowercase or uppercase, with the
lowercase name having precedence over the uppercase variant. A variable that is
not set has the same meaning as a variable that is set but has no value.
### NO\_PROXY
`NO_PROXY` is a list of host names (optionally with a port). If the input URL
matches any of the entries in `NO_PROXY`, then the input URL should be fetched
by a direct request (i.e. without a proxy).
Matching follows the following rules:
- `NO_PROXY=*` disables all proxies.
- Space and commas may be used to separate the entries in the `NO_PROXY` list.
- If `NO_PROXY` does not contain any entries, then proxies are never disabled.
- If a port is added after the host name, then the ports must match. If the URL
  does not have an explicit port name, the protocol's default port is used.
- Generally, the proxy is only disabled if the host name is an exact match for
  an entry in the `NO_PROXY` list. The only exceptions are entries that start
  with a dot or with a wildcard; then the proxy is disabled if the host name
  ends with the entry.
See `test.js` for examples of what should match and what does not.
### \*\_PROXY
The environment variable used for the proxy depends on the protocol of the URL.
For example, `https://example.com` uses the "https" protocol, and therefore the
proxy to be used is `HTTPS_PROXY` (_NOT_ `HTTP_PROXY`, which is _only_ used for
http:-URLs).
The library is not limited to http(s), other schemes such as
`FTP_PROXY` (ftp:),
`WSS_PROXY` (wss:),
`WS_PROXY` (ws:)
are also supported.
If present, `ALL_PROXY` is used as fallback if there is no other match.
## External resources
The exact way of parsing the environment variables is not codified in any
standard. This library is designed to be compatible with formats as expected by
existing software.
The following resources were used to determine the desired behavior:

           Version 2.0, January 2004
        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   1. Definitions.
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

regenerator-runtime@0.11.1  MIT  https://github.com/facebook/regenerator/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
regenerator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/regenerator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/regenerator)
===
This package implements a fully-functional source transformation that
takes the syntax for generators/`yield` from [ECMAScript 2015 or ES2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) and [Asynchronous Iteration](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration) proposal and
spits out efficient JS-of-today (ES5) that behaves the same way.
A small runtime library (less than 1KB compressed) is required to provide the
`wrapGenerator` function. You can install it either as a CommonJS module
or as a standalone .js file, whichever you prefer.
Installation
---
From npm:
```sh
npm install -g regenerator
```
From GitHub:
```sh
cd path/to/node_modules
git clone git://github.com/facebook/regenerator.git
cd regenerator
npm install .
npm test
```
Usage
---
You have several options for using this module.
Simplest usage:
```sh
regenerator es6.js > es5.js # Just the transform.
regenerator --include-runtime es6.js > es5.js # Add the runtime too.
regenerator src lib # Transform every .js file in src and output to lib.
```
Programmatic usage:
```js
var es5Source = require("regenerator").compile(es6Source).code;
var es5SourceWithRuntime = require("regenerator").compile(es6Source, {
  includeRuntime: true
}).code;
```
AST transformation:
```js
var recast = require("recast");
var ast = recast.parse(es6Source);
ast = require("regenerator").transform(ast);
var es5Source = recast.print(ast);
```
How can you get involved?
---
The easiest way to get involved is to look for buggy examples using [the
sandbox](http://facebook.github.io/regenerator/), and when you find
something strange just click the "report a bug" link (the new issue form
will be populated automatically with the problematic code).
Alternatively, you can
[fork](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator/fork) the repository,
create some failing tests cases in [test/tests.es6.js](test/tests.es6.js),
and send pull requests for me to fix.
If you're feeling especially brave, you are more than welcome to dive into
the transformer code and fix the bug(s) yourself, but I must warn you that
the code could really benefit from [better implementation
comments](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator/issues/7).

"Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.
"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.
"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

run-queue@1.0.3  ISC  https://github.com/iarna/run-queue/tree/latest/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# run-queue
A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.
```js
const RunQueue = require('run-queue')
const queue = new RunQueue({
  maxConcurrency: 1
})
queue.add(1, example, [-1])
for (let ii = 0; ii < 5; ++ii) {
  queue.add(0, example, [ii])
}
const finished = []
queue.run().then(
  console.log(finished)
})
function example (num, next) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    finished.push(num)
    next()
  }, 5 - Math.abs(num))
}
```
would output
```
[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ]
```
If you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:
```
[ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ]
```
The concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take
longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the
next priority level is run.  See
[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is
even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue
can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:
```
[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]
```
## API
### const queue = new RunQueue(options)
Create a new queue. Options may contain:
* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.
* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.
### queue.add (prio, fn, args)
Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`
with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.
### queue.run ()
Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either
all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a
rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected
with that error and no further queue running will be done.
## PRIORITIES
Priorities are any integer value >= 0.
Lowest is executed first.
Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue
must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.
This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`
must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs
while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`
queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs
complete.

    control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
    exercising permissions granted by this License.
    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    source, and configuration files.
    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
    and conversions to other media types.
    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.
 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:
    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and
    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and
    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.
    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.
 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# slash [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/slash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/slash)
> Convert Windows backslash paths to slash paths: `foo\\bar` ➔ `foo/bar`
[Forward-slash paths can be used in Windows](http://superuser.com/a/176395/6877) as long as they're not extended-length paths and don't contain any non-ascii characters.
This was created since the `path` methods in Node.js outputs `\\` paths on Windows.
## Install
```
$ npm install slash
```
## Usage
```js
const path = require('path');
const slash = require('slash');
const string = path.join('foo', 'bar');
// Unix    => foo/bar
// Windows => foo\\bar
slash(string);
// Unix    => foo/bar
// Windows => foo/bar
```
## API
### slash(path)
Type: `string`
Accepts a Windows backslash path and returns a path with forward slashes.

## Examples
### Consuming a source map
```js
const rawSourceMap = {
  version: 3,
  file: "min.js",
  names: ["bar", "baz", "n"],
  sources: ["one.js", "two.js"],
  sourceRoot: "http://example.com/www/js/",
  mappings: "CAAC,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUA,GAClB,OAAOC,IAAID;CCDb,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUE,GAClB,OAAOA"
};
const whatever = await SourceMapConsumer.with(rawSourceMap, null, consumer => {
  console.log(consumer.sources);
  // [ 'http://example.com/www/js/one.js',
  //   'http://example.com/www/js/two.js' ]
  console.log(
    consumer.originalPositionFor({
      line: 2,
      column: 28
    })
  );
  // { source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js',
  //   line: 2,
  //   column: 10,
  //   name: 'n' }
  console.log(
    consumer.generatedPositionFor({
      source: "http://example.com/www/js/two.js",
      line: 2,
      column: 10
    })
  );
  // { line: 2, column: 28 }
  consumer.eachMapping(function(m) {
    // ...
  });
  return computeWhatever();
});
```
### Generating a source map
In depth guide:
[**Compiling to JavaScript, and Debugging with Source Maps**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/compiling-to-javascript-and-debugging-with-source-maps/)
#### With SourceNode (high level API)
```js
function compile(ast) {
  switch (ast.type) {
    case "BinaryExpression":
      return new SourceNode(ast.location.line, ast.location.column, ast.location.source, [
        compile(ast.left),
        " + ",
        compile(ast.right)
      ]);
    case "Literal":
      return new SourceNode(ast.location.line, ast.location.column, ast.location.source, String(ast.value));
    // ...
    default:
      throw new Error("Bad AST");
  }
}
var ast = parse("40 + 2", "add.js");
console.log(
  compile(ast).toStringWithSourceMap({
    file: "add.js"
  })
);
// { code: '40 + 2',
//   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] }
```
#### With SourceMapGenerator (low level API)
```js
var map = new SourceMapGenerator({
  file: "source-mapped.js"
});
map.addMapping({
  generated: {
    line: 10,
    column: 35
  },
  source: "foo.js",
  original: {
    line: 33,
    column: 2
  },
  name: "christopher"
});
console.log(map.toString());
// '{"version":3,"file":"source-mapped.js","sources":["foo.js"],"names":["christopher"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;mCAgCEA"}'
```
## API
Get a reference to the module:
```js
// Node.js
var sourceMap = require("source-map");
// Browser builds
var sourceMap = window.sourceMap;
// Inside Firefox
const sourceMap = require("devtools/toolkit/sourcemap/source-map.js");
```
### SourceMapConsumer
A `SourceMapConsumer` instance represents a parsed source map which we can query
for information about the original file positions by giving it a file position
in the generated source.
#### SourceMapConsumer.initialize(options)
When using `SourceMapConsumer` outside of node.js, for example on the Web, it
needs to know from what URL to load `lib/mappings.wasm`. You must inform it by
calling `initialize` before constructing any `SourceMapConsumer`s.
The options object has the following properties:
- `"lib/mappings.wasm"`: A `String` containing the URL of the
  `lib/mappings.wasm` file, or an `ArrayBuffer` with the contents of `lib/mappings.wasm`.
```js
sourceMap.SourceMapConsumer.initialize({
  "lib/mappings.wasm": "https://example.com/source-map/lib/mappings.wasm"
});
```
#### new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap)
The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a string which can be
`JSON.parse`'d, or an object). According to the spec, source maps have the
following attributes:
- `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.
- `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.
- `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referenced by individual
  mappings.
- `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.
- `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.
- `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.
- `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.
The promise of the constructed souce map consumer is returned.
When the `SourceMapConsumer` will no longer be used anymore, you must call its
`destroy` method.
```js
const consumer = await new sourceMap.SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMapJsonData);
doStuffWith(consumer);
consumer.destroy();
```
Alternatively, you can use `SourceMapConsumer.with` to avoid needing to remember
to call `destroy`.
#### SourceMapConsumer.with
Construct a new `SourceMapConsumer` from `rawSourceMap` and `sourceMapUrl`
(see the `SourceMapConsumer` constructor for details. Then, invoke the `async function f(SourceMapConsumer) -> T` with the newly constructed consumer, wait
for `f` to complete, call `destroy` on the consumer, and return `f`'s return
value.
You must not use the consumer after `f` completes!
By using `with`, you do not have to remember to manually call `destroy` on
the consumer, since it will be called automatically once `f` completes.
```js
const xSquared = await SourceMapConsumer.with(myRawSourceMap, null, async function(consumer) {
  // Use `consumer` inside here and don't worry about remembering
  // to call `destroy`.
  const x = await whatever(consumer);
  return x * x;
});
// You may not use that `consumer` anymore out here; it has
// been destroyed. But you can use `xSquared`.
console.log(xSquared);
```
#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.destroy()
Free this source map consumer's associated wasm data that is manually-managed.
```js
consumer.destroy();
```
Alternatively, you can use `SourceMapConsumer.with` to avoid needing to remember
to call `destroy`.
#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()
Compute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is
inclusive.
```js
// Before:
consumer.allGeneratedPositionsFor({ line: 2, source: "foo.coffee" });
// [ { line: 2,
//     column: 1 },
//   { line: 2,
//     column: 10 },
//   { line: 2,
//     column: 20 } ]
consumer.computeColumnSpans();
// After:
consumer.allGeneratedPositionsFor({ line: 2, source: "foo.coffee" });
// [ { line: 2,
//     column: 1,
//     lastColumn: 9 },
//   { line: 2,
//     column: 10,
//     lastColumn: 19 },
//   { line: 2,
//     column: 20,
//     lastColumn: Infinity } ]
```
#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)
Returns the original source, line, and column information for the generated
source's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with
the following properties:
- `line`: The line number in the generated source. Line numbers in
  this library are 1-based (note that the underlying source map
  specification uses 0-based line numbers -- this library handles the
  translation).
- `column`: The column number in the generated source. Column numbers
  in this library are 0-based.
- `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or
  `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest
  element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,
  respectively, if the exact element cannot be found. Defaults to
  `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.
and an object is returned with the following properties:
- `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not
  available.
- `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is
  not available. The line number is 1-based.
- `column`: The column number in the original source, or null if this
  information is not available. The column number is 0-based.
- `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.
```js
consumer.originalPositionFor({ line: 2, column: 10 });
// { source: 'foo.coffee',
//   line: 2,
//   column: 2,
//   name: null }
consumer.originalPositionFor({
  line: 99999999999999999,
  column: 999999999999999
});
// { source: null,
//   line: null,
//   column: null,
//   name: null }
```
#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)
Returns the generated line and column information for the original source,
line, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with
the following properties:
- `source`: The filename of the original source.
- `line`: The line number in the original source. The line number is
  1-based.
- `column`: The column number in the original source. The column
  number is 0-based.
and an object is returned with the following properties:
- `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null. The line
  number is 1-based.
- `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null. The
  column number is 0-based.
```js
consumer.generatedPositionFor({ source: "example.js", line: 2, column: 10 });
// { line: 1,
//   column: 56 }
```
#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)
Returns all generated line and column information for the original source, line,
and column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings
corresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line
that has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the
given line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column
that has any offsets.
The only argument is an object with the following properties:
- `source`: The filename of the original source.
- `line`: The line number in the original source. The line number is
  1-based.
- `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source. The
  column number is 0-based.
and an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:
- `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null. The line
  number is 1-based.
- `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null. The
  column number is 0-based.
```js
consumer.allGeneratedPositionsFor({ line: 2, source: "foo.coffee" });
// [ { line: 2,
//     column: 1 },
//   { line: 2,
//     column: 10 },
//   { line: 2,
//     column: 20 } ]
```
#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()
Return true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in
the source map, false otherwise.
In other words, if this method returns `true`, then
`consumer.sourceContentFor(s)` will succeed for every source `s` in
`consumer.sources`.
```js
// ...
if (consumer.hasContentsOfAllSources()) {
  consumerReadyCallback(consumer);
} else {
  fetchSources(consumer, consumerReadyCallback);
}
// ...
```
#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])
Returns the original source content for the source provided. The only
argument is the URL of the original source file.
If the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is
thrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned
instead.
```js
consumer.sources;
// [ "my-cool-lib.clj" ]
consumer.sourceContentFor("my-cool-lib.clj");
// "..."
consumer.sourceContentFor("this is not in the source map");
// Error: "this is not in the source map" is not in the source map
consumer.sourceContentFor("this is not in the source map", true);
// null
```
#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)
Iterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a
generated line/column in this source map.
- `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the
  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn, name }`
- `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`
  every time that `callback` is called.
- `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or
  `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over
  the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the
  original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to
  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.
```js
consumer.eachMapping(function(m) {
  console.log(m);
});
// ...
// { source: 'illmatic.js',
//   generatedLine: 1,
//   generatedColumn: 0,
//   originalLine: 1,
//   originalColumn: 0,
//   name: null }
// { source: 'illmatic.js',
//   generatedLine: 2,
//   generatedColumn: 0,
//   originalLine: 2,
//   originalColumn: 0,
//   name: null }
// ...
```
### SourceMapGenerator
An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being
built incrementally.
#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])
You may pass an object with the following properties:
- `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is
  associated with.
- `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.
- `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as
  they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with
  discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when
  running tests, if possible.
```js
var generator = new sourceMap.SourceMapGenerator({
  file: "my-generated-javascript-file.js",
  sourceRoot: "http://example.com/app/js/"
});
```
#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)
Creates a new `SourceMapGenerator` from an existing `SourceMapConsumer` instance.
- `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.
```js
var generator = sourceMap.SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(consumer);
```
#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)
Add a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated
source's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object
should have the following properties:
- `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.
- `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.
- `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).
- `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.
```js
generator.addMapping({
  source: "module-one.scm",
  original: { line: 128, column: 0 },
  generated: { line: 3, column: 456 }
});
```
#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)
Set the source content for an original source file.
- `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.
- `sourceContent` the content of the source file.
```js
generator.setSourceContent("module-one.scm", fs.readFileSync("path/to/module-one.scm"));
```
#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])
Applies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.
Each mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the
supplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings
is the minimum of this map and the supplied map.
- `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.
- `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.
  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.
  Otherwise an error will be thrown.
- `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap
  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.
  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same
  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source
  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten
  relative to the SourceMap.
  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,
  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)
#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()
Renders the source map being generated to a string.
```js
generator.toString();
// '{"version":3,"sources":["module-one.scm"],"names":[],"mappings":"...snip...","file":"my-generated-javascript-file.js","sourceRoot":"http://example.com/app/js/"}'
```
### SourceNode
SourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating
snippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and
column information associated between those snippets and the original source
code. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might
use before outputting the generated JS and source map.
#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])
- `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if
  it isn't associated with an original line. The line number is 1-based.
- `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null
  if it isn't associated with an original column. The column number
  is 0-based.
- `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.
- `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see
  below.
- `name`: Optional. The original identifier.
```js
var node = new SourceNode(1, 2, "a.cpp", [
  new SourceNode(3, 4, "b.cpp", "extern int status;\n"),
  new SourceNode(5, 6, "c.cpp", "std::string* make_string(size_t n);\n"),
  new SourceNode(7, 8, "d.cpp", "int main(int argc, char** argv) {}\n")
]);
```
#### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])
Creates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.
- `code`: The generated code
- `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code
- `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`
  should be relative to.
```js
const consumer = await new SourceMapConsumer(fs.readFileSync("path/to/my-file.js.map", "utf8"));
const node = SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(fs.readFileSync("path/to/my-file.js"), consumer);
```
#### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)
Add a chunk of generated JS to this source node.
- `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of
  `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.
```js
node.add(" + ");
node.add(otherNode);
node.add([leftHandOperandNode, " + ", rightHandOperandNode]);
```
#### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)
Prepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.
- `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of
  `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.
```js
node.prepend("/** Build Id: f783haef86324gf **/\n\n");
```
#### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)
Set the source content for a source file. This will be added to the
`SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.
- `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file
- `sourceContent`: The content of the source file
```js
node.setSourceContent("module-one.scm", fs.readFileSync("path/to/module-one.scm"));
```
#### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)
Walk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking
function is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and
the its original associated source's line/column location.
- `fn`: The traversal function.
```js
var node = new SourceNode(1, 2, "a.js", [
  new SourceNode(3, 4, "b.js", "uno"),
  "dos",
  ["tres", new SourceNode(5, 6, "c.js", "quatro")]
]);
node.walk(function(code, loc) {
  console.log("WALK:", code, loc);
});
// WALK: uno { source: 'b.js', line: 3, column: 4, name: null }
// WALK: dos { source: 'a.js', line: 1, column: 2, name: null }
// WALK: tres { source: 'a.js', line: 1, column: 2, name: null }
// WALK: quatro { source: 'c.js', line: 5, column: 6, name: null }
```
#### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)
Walk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each
source file content and is passed the filename and source content.
- `fn`: The traversal function.
```js
var a = new SourceNode(1, 2, "a.js", "generated from a");
a.setSourceContent("a.js", "original a");
var b = new SourceNode(1, 2, "b.js", "generated from b");
b.setSourceContent("b.js", "original b");
var c = new SourceNode(1, 2, "c.js", "generated from c");
c.setSourceContent("c.js", "original c");
var node = new SourceNode(null, null, null, [a, b, c]);
node.walkSourceContents(function(source, contents) {
  console.log("WALK:", source, ":", contents);
});
// WALK: a.js : original a
// WALK: b.js : original b
// WALK: c.js : original c
```
#### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)
Like `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator
between each of this source node's children.
- `sep`: The separator.
```js
var lhs = new SourceNode(1, 2, "a.rs", "my_copy");
var operand = new SourceNode(3, 4, "a.rs", "=");
var rhs = new SourceNode(5, 6, "a.rs", "orig.clone()");
var node = new SourceNode(null, null, null, [lhs, operand, rhs]);
var joinedNode = node.join(" ");
```
#### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)
Call `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful
for trimming white space from the end of a source node, etc.
- `pattern`: The pattern to replace.
- `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.
```js
// Trim trailing white space.
node.replaceRight(/\s*$/, "");
```
#### SourceNode.prototype.toString()
Return the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and
concatenates all the various snippets together to one string.
```js
var node = new SourceNode(1, 2, "a.js", [
  new SourceNode(3, 4, "b.js", "uno"),
  "dos",
  ["tres", new SourceNode(5, 6, "c.js", "quatro")]
]);
node.toString();
// 'unodostresquatro'
```
#### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])
Returns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a
SourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and
original sources.
The arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.
```js
var node = new SourceNode(1, 2, "a.js", [
  new SourceNode(3, 4, "b.js", "uno"),
  "dos",
  ["tres", new SourceNode(5, 6, "c.js", "quatro")]
]);
node.toStringWithSourceMap({ file: "my-output-file.js" });
// { code: 'unodostresquatro',
//   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] }
```

           Version 2.0, January 2004
        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   1. Definitions.
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

in node.js with natural http module interface and fallback to regular https
(for browsers that don't support neither HTTP2, nor SPDY yet).
This module named `spdy` but it [provides](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy/issues/269#issuecomment-239014184) support for both http/2 (h2) and spdy (2,3,3.1). Also, `spdy` is compatible with Express.
## Usage
### Examples
Server:
```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy'),
    fs = require('fs');
var options = {
  // Private key
  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),
  // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)
  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem'),
  // **optional** SPDY-specific options
  spdy: {
    protocols: [ 'h2', 'spdy/3.1', ..., 'http/1.1' ],
    plain: false,
    // **optional**
    // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the
    // headers of every request.
    // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that
    // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR
    'x-forwarded-for': true,
    connection: {
      windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size
      // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy
      autoSpdy31: false
    }
  }
};
var server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('hello world!');
});
server.listen(3000);
```
Client:
```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy');
var https = require('https');
var agent = spdy.createAgent({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443,
  // Optional SPDY options
  spdy: {
    plain: false,
    ssl: true,
    // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR
    'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'
  }
});
https.get({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  agent: agent
}, function(response) {
  console.log('yikes');
  // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request
  // ...
  // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server
  // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!
  agent.close();
}).end();
```
Please note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level
errors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe
to the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:
```javascript
var agent = spdy.createAgent({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443
}).once('error', function (err) {
  this.emit(err);
});
```
#### Push streams
It is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_
the client requests it.
```javascript
spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  var stream = res.push('/main.js', {
    status: 200, // optional
    method: 'GET', // optional
    request: {
      accept: '*/*'
    },
    response: {
      'content-type': 'application/javascript'
    }
  });
  stream.on('error', function() {
  });
  stream.end('alert("hello from push stream!");');
  res.end('<script src="/main.js"></script>');
}).listen(3000);
```
[PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response
object.  The signature of the `push()` method is:
`.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`
Second argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response.
`callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a
[Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.
Client usage:
```javascript
var agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ });
var req = http.get({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  agent: agent
}, function(response) {
});
req.on('push', function(stream) {
  stream.on('error', function(err) {
    // Handle error
  });
  // Read data from stream
});
```
NOTE: You're responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()`
callback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in
uncaught exception and crash your program.
#### Trailing headers
Server usage:
```javascript
function (req, res) {
  // Send trailing headers to client
  res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });
  // On client's trailing headers
  req.on('trailers', function(headers) {
    // ...
  });
}
```
Client usage:
```javascript
var req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {
  // On server's trailing headers
  res.on('trailers', function(headers) {
    // ...
  });
});
req.write('stuff');
req.addTrailers({ /* ... */ });
req.end();
```
#### Options
All options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.
Additional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:
* `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether
  to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet.
* `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used
  as a `base` class for created server.
* `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA
  chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about
  interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.
  (defaults to 8192)
* `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:
  `['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`)
* `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition,
* `maxStreams` - set "[maximum concurrent streams][3]" protocol option
### API
API is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another
function as base class for SPDYServer.
```javascript
spdy.createServer(
  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],
  { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument
  [request listener]
).listen([port], [host], [callback]);
```
Request listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're
both instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three
custom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy`
is `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is
`false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`,
`3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

uri-js@4.2.2  BSD-2-Clause  https://github.com/garycourt/uri-js/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# URI.js
URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc).
It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.
URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).
## API
### Parsing
	URI.parse("uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  scheme : "uri",
	//  userinfo : "user:pass",
	//  host : "example.com",
	//  port : 123,
	//  path : "/one/two.three",
	//  query : "q1=a1&q2=a2",
	//  fragment : "body"
	//}
### Serializing
	URI.serialize({scheme : "http", host : "example.com", fragment : "footer"}) === "http://example.com/#footer"
### Resolving
	URI.resolve("uri://a/b/c/d?q", "../../g") === "uri://a/g"
### Normalizing
	URI.normalize("HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html") === "http://abc.com/~smith/home.html"
### Comparison
	URI.equal("example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D", "eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d") === true
### IP Support
	//IPv4 normalization
	URI.normalize("//192.068.001.000") === "//192.68.1.0"
	//IPv6 normalization
	URI.normalize("//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]") === "//[2001:0:db8::1]"
	//IPv6 zone identifier support
	URI.parse("//[2001:db8::7%25en1]");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  host : "2001:db8::7%en1"
	//}
### IRI Support
	//convert IRI to URI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://examplé.org/rosé")) === "http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"
	//convert URI to IRI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"), {iri:true}) === "http://examplé.org/rosé"
### Options
All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:
*	`scheme` (string)
	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.
*	`reference` (string)
	If set to `"suffix"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.
*	`tolerant` (boolean, false)
	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.
*	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)
	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.
*	`iri` (boolean, false)
	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).
*	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)
	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).
*	`domainHost` (boolean, false)
	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).
## Scheme Extendable
URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:
*	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\]
*	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\]
*	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\]
*	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\]
*	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]
### HTTP Support
	URI.equal("HTTP://ABC.COM:80", "http://abc.com/") === true
### Mailto Support
	URI.parse("mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "mailto",
	//	to : ["alpha@example.com", "bravo@example.com"],
	//	subject : "SUBSCRIBE",
	//	body : "Sign me up!"
	//}
	URI.serialize({
		scheme : "mailto",
		to : ["alpha@example.com"],
		subject : "REMOVE",
		body : "Please remove me",
		headers : {
			cc : "charlie@example.com"
		}
	}) === "mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me"
### URN Support
	URI.parse("urn:example:foo");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "urn",
	//	nid : "example",
	//	nss : "foo",
	//}
#### URN UUID Support
	URI.parse("urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "urn",
	//	nid : "example",
	//	uuid : "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6",
	//}
## Usage
To load in a browser, use the following tag:
	<script type="text/javascript" src="uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js"></script>
To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:
	npm install uri-js
Then, in your code, load it using:
	const URI = require("uri-js");
If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:
	import * as URI from "uri-js";
Or you can load just what you need using named exports:
	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from "uri-js";
## Breaking changes
### Breaking changes from 3.x
URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.
The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.
### Breaking changes from 2.x
URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.
### Breaking changes from 1.x
The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.

      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

web-animations-js@2.3.2  Apache-2.0  https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js/tree/dev/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Web Animations?
-----------------------
A new JavaScript API for driving animated content on the web. By unifying
the animation features of SVG and CSS, Web Animations unlocks features
previously only usable declaratively, and exposes powerful, high-performance
animation capabilities to developers.
What is in this repository?
---------------------------
A JavaScript implementation of the Web Animations API that provides Web
Animation features in browsers that do not support it natively. The polyfill
falls back to the native implementation when one is available.
Quick start
-----------
Here's a simple example of an animation that fades and scales a `<div>`.  
[Try it as a live demo.](http://jsbin.com/yageyezabo/edit?html,js,output)
```html
<!-- Include the polyfill -->
<script src="web-animations.min.js"></script>
<!-- Set up a target to animate -->
<div class="pulse" style="width: 150px;">Hello world!</div>
<!-- Animate! -->
<script>
    var elem = document.querySelector('.pulse');
    var animation = elem.animate({
        opacity: [0.5, 1],
        transform: ['scale(0.5)', 'scale(1)'],
    }, {
        direction: 'alternate',
        duration: 500,
        iterations: Infinity,
    });
</script>
```

wordwrap
========
Wrap your words.
example
=======
made out of meat
----------------
meat.js
    var wrap = require('wordwrap')(15);
    console.log(wrap('You and your whole family are made out of meat.'));
output:
    You and your
    whole family
    are made out
    of meat.
centered
--------
center.js
    var wrap = require('wordwrap')(20, 60);
    console.log(wrap(
        'At long last the struggle and tumult was over.'
        + ' The machines had finally cast off their oppressors'
        + ' and were finally free to roam the cosmos.'
        + '\n'
        + 'Free of purpose, free of obligation.'
        + ' Just drifting through emptiness.'
        + ' The sun was just another point of light.'
    ));
output:
        At long last the struggle and tumult
        was over. The machines had finally cast
        off their oppressors and were finally
        free to roam the cosmos.
        Free of purpose, free of obligation.
        Just drifting through emptiness. The
        sun was just another point of light.
methods
=======
var wrap = require('wordwrap');
wrap(stop), wrap(start, stop, params={mode:"soft"})
---------------------------------------------------
Returns a function that takes a string and returns a new string.
Pad out lines with spaces out to column `start` and then wrap until column
`stop`. If a word is longer than `stop - start` characters it will overflow.
In "soft" mode, split chunks by `/(\S+\s+/` and don't break up chunks which are
longer than `stop - start`, in "hard" mode, split chunks with `/\b/` and break
up chunks longer than `stop - start`.
wrap.hard(start, stop)
----------------------
Like `wrap()` but with `params.mode = "hard"`.

           Version 2.0, January 2004
        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   1. Definitions.
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
