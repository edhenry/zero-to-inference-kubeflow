|@fortawesome/angular-fontawesome|Angular|ng-add|
|-|-|-|
|0.1.x|5.x|not supported|
|0.2.x|6.x|not supported|
|0.3.x|6.x && 7.x|not supported|

## Usage
To get up and running using Font Awesome with Angular follow below steps:

1. Add `FontAwesomeModule` to `imports` in
`src/app/app.module.ts`:

    ```typescript
    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
    
    import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
    import { FontAwesomeModule } from '@fortawesome/angular-fontawesome';
    
    @NgModule({
      imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        FontAwesomeModule
      ],
      declarations: [AppComponent],
      bootstrap: [AppComponent]
    })
    export class AppModule { }
    ```

2. Tie the icon to the property in your component
`src/app/app.component.ts`:

    ```typescript
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    import { faCoffee } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';
    
    @Component({
      selector: 'app-root',
      templateUrl: './app.component.html'
    })
    export class AppComponent {
      faCoffee = faCoffee;
    }
    ```

3. Use the icon in the template
`src/app/app.component.html`:

    ```html
    <fa-icon [icon]="faCoffee"></fa-icon>
    ```

## What are declaration files?

See the [TypeScript handbook](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html).

## How do I get them?

### npm

This is the preferred method. For example:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

The types should then be automatically included by the compiler.
You may need to add a `types` reference if you're not using modules:

```ts
/// <reference types="node" />
```

See more in the [handbook](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/consumption.html).

For an NPM package "foo", typings for it will be at "@types/foo".
If you can't find your package, look for it on [TypeSearch](https://microsoft.github.io/TypeSearch/).

If you still can't find it, check if it [bundles](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html) its own typings.
This is usually provided in a `"types"` or `"typings"` field in the `package.json`,
or just look for any ".d.ts" files in the package and manually include them with a `/// <reference path="" />`.

#### Typescript 2.7 and earlier

Definitely Typed only tests packages on Typescript 2.8 and later as of November 2019.
If you're using Typescript 2.0 to 2.7, you can still try installing `@types` packages &mdash; the majority of packages don't use fancy new Typescript features.
But there's no guarantee that they'll work.
Packages that existed before November 2019 may have older versions that are explicitly marked compatible with older versions of Typescript; use the tag "ts2.6" for Typescript 2.6, for example.

For example, if you run `npm dist-tags @types/react`, you'll see the following table that shows that react@16.4 has types for Typescript 2.6:

|Tag | Version|
|----|---------|
|latest| 16.9.11|
|ts2.0| 15.0.1|
| ... | ... |
|ts2.6| 16.4.7|
| ... | ... |


### Typescript 1.8 and earlier

* Manually download from the `master` branch of this repository and place them in your project
* ~~[Typings](https://github.com/typings/typings)~~ (use preferred alternatives, typings is deprecated)
* ~~[NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages?q=DefinitelyTyped)~~ (use preferred alternatives, nuget DT type publishing has been turned off)

You may need to add manual [references](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html).

## How can I contribute?

Definitely Typed only works because of contributions by users like you!

### Test

Before you share your improvement with the world, use it yourself.

#### Test editing an existing package

To add new features you can use [module augmentation](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation).
You can also directly edit the types in `node_modules/@types/foo/index.d.ts`, or copy them from there and follow the steps below.


#### Test a new package

Add to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
"baseUrl": "types",
"typeRoots": ["types"],
```

(You can also use `src/types`.)
Create `types/foo/index.d.ts` containing declarations for the module "foo".
You should now be able to import from `"foo"` in your code and it will route to the new type definition.
Then build *and* run the code to make sure your type definition actually corresponds to what happens at runtime.
Once you've tested your definitions with real code, make a [PR](#make-a-pull-request)
then follow the instructions to [edit an existing package](#edit-an-existing-package) or
[create a new package](#create-a-new-package).


### Make a pull request

Once you've tested your package, you can share it on Definitely Typed.

First, [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repository, install [node](https://nodejs.org/), and run `npm install`.


#### Edit an existing package

* `cd types/my-package-to-edit`
* Make changes. Remember to edit tests.
  If you make breaking changes, do not forget to [update a major version](#if-a-library-is-updated-to-a-new-major-version-with-breaking-changes-how-should-i-update-its-type-declaration-package).
* You may also want to add yourself to "Definitions by" section of the package header.
  - This will cause you to be notified (via your GitHub username) whenever someone makes a pull request or issue about the package.
  - Do this by adding your name to the end of the line, as in `// Definitions by: Alice <https://github.com/alice>, Bob <https://github.com/bob>`.
  - Or if there are more people, it can be multiline
  ```typescript
  // Definitions by: Alice <https://github.com/alice>
  //                 Bob <https://github.com/bob>
  //                 Steve <https://github.com/steve>
  //                 John <https://github.com/john>
  ```
* If there is a `tslint.json`, run `npm run lint package-name`. Otherwise, run `tsc` in the package directory.

When you make a PR to edit an existing package, `dt-bot` should @-mention previous authors.
If it doesn't, you can do so yourself in the comment associated with the PR.


#### Create a new package

If you are the library author and your package is written in TypeScript, [bundle the autogenerated declaration files](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html) in your package instead of publishing to Definitely Typed.

If you are adding typings for an NPM package, create a directory with the same name.
If the package you are adding typings for is not on NPM, make sure the name you choose for it does not conflict with the name of a package on NPM.
(You can use `npm info foo` to check for the existence of the `foo` package.)

Your package should have this structure:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| index.d.ts | This contains the typings for the package. |
| foo-tests.ts | This contains sample code which tests the typings. This code does *not* run, but it is type-checked. |
| tsconfig.json | This allows you to run `tsc` within the package. |
| tslint.json | Enables linting. |

Generate these by running `npx dts-gen --dt --name my-package-name --template module` if you have npm ≥ 5.2.0, `npm install -g dts-gen` and `dts-gen --dt --name my-package-name --template module` otherwise.
See all options at [dts-gen](https://github.com/Microsoft/dts-gen).

You may edit the `tsconfig.json` to add new test files, to add `"target": "es6"` (needed for async functions), to add to `"lib"`, or to add the `"jsx"` compiler option. If you have `.d.ts` files besides `index.d.ts`, make sure that they are referenced either in `index.d.ts` or the tests.

If a file is neither tested nor referenced in `index.d.ts`, add it to a file named `OTHER_FILES.txt`. This file is a list of other files that need to be included in the typings package, one file per line.

Definitely Typed members routinely monitor for new PRs, though keep in mind that the number of other PRs may slow things down.

For a good example package, see [base64-js](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/base64-js).


#### Common mistakes

* First, follow advice from the [handbook](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/do-s-and-don-ts.html).
* Formatting: Use 4 spaces. Prettier is set up on this repo, so you can run `npm run prettier -- --write path/to/package`. [When using assertions](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/tsd#assertions), add `// prettier-ignore` exclusion to mark line(s) of code as excluded from formatting:
    ```tsx
    // prettier-ignore
    const incompleteThemeColorModes: Theme = { colors: { modes: { papaya: { // $ExpectError
    ```
* `function sum(nums: number[]): number`: Use `ReadonlyArray` if a function does not write to its parameters.
* `interface Foo { new(): Foo; }`:
    This defines a type of objects that are new-able. You probably want `declare class Foo { constructor(); }`.
* `const Class: { new(): IClass; }`:
    Prefer to use a class declaration `class Class { constructor(); }` instead of a new-able constant.
* `getMeAT<T>(): T`:
    If a type parameter does not appear in the types of any parameters, you don't really have a generic function, you just have a disguised type assertion.
    Prefer to use a real type assertion, e.g. `getMeAT() as number`.
    Example where a type parameter is acceptable: `function id<T>(value: T): T;`.
    Example where it is not acceptable: `function parseJson<T>(json: string): T;`.
    Exception: `new Map<string, number>()` is OK.
* Using the types `Function` and `Object` is almost never a good idea. In 99% of cases it's possible to specify a more specific type. Examples are `(x: number) => number` for [functions](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/functions.html#function-types) and `{ x: number, y: number }` for objects. If there is no certainty at all about the type, [`any`](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#any) is the right choice, not `Object`. If the only known fact about the type is that it's some object, use the type [`object`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-2.html#object-type), not `Object` or `{ [key: string]: any }`.
* `var foo: string | any`:
    When `any` is used in a union type, the resulting type is still `any`. So while the `string` portion of this type annotation may _look_ useful, it in fact offers no additional typechecking over simply using `any`.
    Depending on the intention, acceptable alternatives could be `any`, `string`, or `string | object`.


#### Removing a package

When a package [bundles](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html) its own types, types should be removed from Definitely Typed to avoid confusion.

You can remove it by running `npm run not-needed -- typingsPackageName asOfVersion sourceRepoURL [libraryName]`.
- `typingsPackageName`: This is the name of the directory to delete.
- `asOfVersion`: A stub will be published to `@types/foo` with this version. Should be higher than any currently published version, and should be a version of `foo` on npm.
- `sourceRepoURL`: This should point to the repository that contains the typings.
- `libraryName`: Name of npm package that replaces the Definitely Typed types. Usually this is identical to "typingsPackageName", in which case you can omit it.

Any other packages in Definitely Typed that referenced the deleted package should be updated to reference the bundled types.
You can get this list by looking at the errors from `npm run test`.
To fix the errors, add a `package.json` with `"dependencies": { "foo": "x.y.z" }`.
For example:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "foo": "^2.6.0"
  }
}
```

When you add a `package.json` to dependents of `foo`, you will also need to open a PR to add `foo` [to dependenciesWhitelist.txt in types-publisher](https://github.com/Microsoft/types-publisher/blob/master/dependenciesWhitelist.txt).

If a package was never on Definitely Typed, it does not need to be added to `notNeededPackages.json`.

#### Linter

All new packages must be linted. To lint a package, add a `tslint.json` to that package containing
```js
{
    "extends": "dtslint/dt.json"
}
```

This should be the only content in a finished project's `tslint.json` file. If a `tslint.json` turns rules off, this is because that hasn't been fixed yet. For example:

```js
{
    "extends": "dtslint/dt.json",
    "rules": {
        // This package uses the Function type, and it will take effort to fix.
        "ban-types": false
    }
}
```

(To indicate that a lint rule truly does not apply, use `// tslint:disable rule-name` or better, `//tslint:disable-next-line rule-name`.)

To assert that an expression is of a given type, use `$ExpectType`. To assert that an expression causes a compile error, use `$ExpectError`.

```js
// $ExpectType void
f(1);

// $ExpectError
f("one");
```

For more details, see [dtslint](https://github.com/Microsoft/dtslint#write-tests) readme.

## Verifying

Test your changes by running `npm run lint package-name` where `package-name` is the name of your package.

This script uses [dtslint](https://github.com/Microsoft/dtslint) to run the TypeScript compiler against your dts files.


## FAQ

#### What exactly is the relationship between this repository and the `@types` packages on NPM?

The `master` branch is automatically published to the `@types` scope on NPM thanks to [types-publisher](https://github.com/Microsoft/types-publisher).

#### I've submitted a pull request. How long until it is merged?

It depends, but most pull requests will be merged within a week. PRs that have been approved by an author listed in the definition's header are usually merged more quickly; PRs for new definitions will take more time as they require more review from maintainers. Each PR is reviewed by a TypeScript or Definitely Typed team member before being merged, so please be patient as human factors may cause delays. Check the [PR Burndown Board](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/projects/3?card_filter_query=is%3Aopen) to see progress as maintainers work through the open PRs.

#### My PR is merged; when will the `@types` NPM package be updated?

NPM packages should update within a few minutes. If it's been more than an hour, mention the PR number on [the Definitely Typed Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) and the current maintainer will get the correct team member to investigate.

#### I'm writing a definition that depends on another definition. Should I use `<reference types="" />` or an import?

If the module you're referencing is an external module (uses `export`), use an import.
If the module you're referencing is an ambient module (uses `declare module`, or just declares globals), use `<reference types="" />`.

#### I notice some packages having a `package.json` here.

Usually you won't need this.
Definitely Typed's package publisher creates a `package.json` for packages with no dependencies outside Definitely Typed.
A `package.json` may be included to specify dependencies that are not other `@types` packages.
[Pikaday is a good example.](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/pikaday/package.json)
Even if you write your own `package.json`, you can only specify dependencies; other fields such as `"description"` are not allowed.
You also need to add the dependency to [the list of allowed packages](https://github.com/microsoft/types-publisher/blob/master/dependenciesWhitelist.txt).
This list is updated by a human, which gives us the chance to make sure that `@types` packages don't depend on malicious packages.

In the rare case that an `@types` package is deleted and removed in favor of types shipped by the source package AND you need to depend on the old, removed `@types` package, you can add a dependency on an `@types` package.
Be sure to explain this when adding to the list of allowed packages so that the human maintainer knows what is happening.

#### Some packages have no `tslint.json`, and some `tsconfig.json` are missing `"noImplicitAny": true`, `"noImplicitThis": true`, or `"strictNullChecks": true`.

Then they are wrong. You can help by submitting a pull request to fix them.

#### Can I request a definition?

Here are the [currently requested definitions](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/labels/Definition%3ARequest).

#### What about type definitions for the DOM?

If types are part of a web standard, they should be contributed to [TSJS-lib-generator](https://github.com/Microsoft/TSJS-lib-generator) so that they can become part of the default `lib.dom.d.ts`.

#### Should I add an empty namespace to a package that doesn't export a module to use ES6 style imports?

Some packages, like [chai-http](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-http), export a function.

Importing this module with an ES6 style import in the form `import * as foo from "foo";` leads to the error:

> error TS2497: Module 'foo' resolves to a non-module entity and cannot be imported using this construct

This error can be suppressed by merging the function declaration with an empty namespace of the same name, but this practice is discouraged.
This is a commonly cited [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39415661/what-does-resolves-to-a-non-module-entity-and-cannot-be-imported-using-this) regarding this matter.

It is more appropriate to import the module using the `import foo = require("foo");` syntax.
Nevertheless, if you want to use a default import like `import foo from "foo";` you have two options:
- you can use the [`--allowSyntheticDefaultImports` compiler option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-1-8.html#support-for-default-import-interop-with-systemjs) if your module runtime supports an interop scheme for non-ECMAScript modules, i.e. if default imports work in your environment (e.g. Webpack, SystemJS, esm).
- you can use the [`--esModuleInterop` compiler option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-7.html#support-for-import-d-from-cjs-form-commonjs-modules-with---esmoduleinterop) if you want TypeScript to take care of non-ECMAScript interop (since Typescript 2.7).

#### A package uses `export =`, but I prefer to use default imports. Can I change `export =` to `export default`?

Like in the previous question, refer to using either the [`--allowSyntheticDefaultImports`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-1-8.html#support-for-default-import-interop-with-systemjs)
or [`--esModuleInterop`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-7.html#support-for-import-d-from-cjs-form-commonjs-modules-with---esmoduleinterop)
compiler options.

Do not change the type definition if it is accurate.
For an NPM package, `export =` is accurate if `node -p 'require("foo")'` works to import a module, and `export default` is accurate if `node -p 'require("foo").default'` works to import a module.

#### I want to use features from TypeScript 2.9 or above.

Then you will have to add a comment to the last line of your definition header (after `// Definitions: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped`): `// TypeScript Version: 2.9`.

#### I want to use features from TypeScript 3.1 or above.

You can use the same `// TypeScript Version: 3.1` comment as above.
However, if your project needs to maintain types that are compatible with 3.1 and above *at the same time as* types that are compatible with 3.0 or below, you will need to use the `typesVersions` feature, which is available in TypeScript 3.1 and above.
You can find a detailed explanation of this feature in the [official TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-1.html#version-selection-with-typesversions).

Here's a short explanation to get you started:

1. You'll have to add a `package.json` file to your package definition, with the following contents:

```json
{
    "private": true,
    "types": "index",
    "typesVersions": {
        ">=3.1.0-0": { "*": ["ts3.1/*"] }
    }
}
```

2. Create the sub-directory mentioned in the `typesVersions` field inside your types directory (`ts3.1/` in this example)
and add the types and tests specific for the new TypeScript version. You don't need the typical definition header
in any of the files from the `ts3.1/` directory.

3. Set the `baseUrl` and `typeRoots` options in `ts3.1/tsconfig.json` to the correct paths, they should look something like this:
```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "../../",
        "typeRoots": ["../../"]
    }

#### I want to add a DOM API not present in TypeScript by default.

This may belong in [TSJS-Lib-Generator](https://github.com/Microsoft/TSJS-lib-generator#readme). See the guidelines there.
If the standard is still a draft, it belongs here.
Use a name beginning with `dom-` and include a link to the standard as the "Project" link in the header.
When it graduates draft mode, we may remove it from Definitely Typed and deprecate the associated `@types` package.

#### How do Definitely Typed package versions relate to versions of the corresponding library?

_NOTE: The discussion in this section assumes familiarity with [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)_

Each Definitely Typed package is versioned when published to NPM.
The [types-publisher](https://github.com/Microsoft/types-publisher) (the tool that publishes `@types` packages to npm) will set the declaration package's version by using the `major.minor` version number listed in the first line of its `index.d.ts` file.
For example, here are the first few lines of [Node's type declarations](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/1253faabf5e0d2c5470db6ea87795d7f96fef7e2/types/node/index.d.ts) for version `10.12.x` at the time of writing:

```js
// Type definitions for Node.js 10.12
// Project: http://nodejs.org/
// Definitions by: Microsoft TypeScript <https://github.com/Microsoft>
//                 Definitely Typed <https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped>
//                 Alberto Schiabel <https://github.com/jkomyno>
```

Because `10.12` is at the end the first line, the npm version of the `@types/node` package will also be `10.12.x`.
Note that the first-line comment in the `index.d.ts` file should only contain the `major.minor` version (e.g. `10.12`) and should not contain a patch version (e.g. `10.12.4`).
This is because only the major and minor release numbers are aligned between library packages and type declaration packages.
The patch release number of the type declaration package (e.g. `.0` in `10.12.0`) is initialized to zero by Definitely Typed and is incremented each time a new `@types/node` package is published to NPM for the same major/minor version of the corresponding library.

Sometimes type declaration package versions and library package versions can get out of sync.
Below are a few common reasons why, in order of how much they inconvenience users of a library.
Only the last case is typically problematic.

* As noted above, the patch version of the type declaration package is unrelated to the library patch version.
  This allows Definitely Typed to safely update type declarations for the same major/minor version of a library.
* If updating a package for new functionality, don't forget to update the version number to line up with that version of the library.
  If users make sure versions correspond between JavaScript packages and their respective `@types` packages, then `npm update` should typically just work.
* It's common for type declaration package updates to lag behind library updates because it's often library users, not maintainers, who update Definitely Typed when new library features are released.
  So there may be a lag of days, weeks, or even months before a helpful community member sends a PR to update the type declaration package for a new library release.
  If you're impacted by this, you can be the change you want to see in the world and you can be that helpful community member!

:exclamation: If you're updating type declarations for a library, always set the `major.minor` version in the first line of `index.d.ts` to match the library version that you're documenting! :exclamation:

#### If a library is updated to a new major version with breaking changes, how should I update its type declaration package?

[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) requires that versions with breaking changes must increment the major version number.
For example, a library that removes a publicly exported function after its `3.5.8` release must bump its version to `4.0.0` in its next release.
Furthermore, when the library's `4.0.0` release is out, its Definitely Typed type declaration package should also be updated to `4.0.0`, including any breaking changes to the library's API.

Many libraries have a large installed base of developers (including maintainers of other packages using that library as a dependency) who won't move right away to a new version that has breaking changes, because it might be months until a maintainer has time to rewrite code to adapt to the new version.
In the meantime, users of old library versions still may want to update type declarations for older versions.

If you intend to continue updating the older version of a library's type declarations, you may create a new subfolder (e.g. `/v2/`) named for the current (soon to be "old") version, and copy existing files from the current version to it.

Because the root folder should always contain the type declarations for the latest ("new") version, you'll need to make a few changes to the files in your old-version subdirectory to ensure that relative path references point to the subdirectory, not the root.

1. Update the relative paths in `tsconfig.json` as well as `tslint.json`.
2. Add path mapping rules to ensure that tests are running against the intended version.

For example, the [`history`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history/) library introduced breaking changes between version `2.x` and `3.x`.
Because many users still consumed the older `2.x` version, a maintainer who wanted to update the type declarations for this library to `3.x` added a `v2` folder inside the history repository that contains type declarations for the older version.
At the time of writing, the [history v2 `tsconfig.json`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/1253faabf5e0d2c5470db6ea87795d7f96fef7e2/types/history/v2/tsconfig.json) looks roughly like:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "../../",
        "typeRoots": ["../../"],
        "paths": {
            "history": [ "history/v2" ]
        },
    },
    "files": [
        "index.d.ts",
        "history-tests.ts"
    ]
}
```

If there are other packages in Definitely Typed that are incompatible with the new version, you will need to add path mappings to the old version.
You will also need to do this recursively for packages depending on packages depending on the old version.

For example, `react-router` depends on `history@2`, so [react-router `tsconfig.json`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react-router/v2/tsconfig.json) has a path mapping to `"history": [ "history/v2" ]`.
Transitively, `react-router-bootstrap` (which depends on `react-router`) also needed to add the same path mapping (`"history": [ "history/v2" ]`) in its `tsconfig.json` until its `react-router` dependency was updated to the latest version.

Also, `/// <reference types=".." />` will not work with path mapping, so dependencies must use `import`.

#### How do I write definitions for packages that can be used globally and as a module?

The TypeScript handbook contains excellent [general information about writing definitions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html), and also [this example definition file](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/global-modifying-module-d-ts.html) which shows how to create a definition using ES6-style module syntax, while also specifying objects made available to the global scope.  This technique is demonstrated practically in the [definition for big.js](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/big.js/index.d.ts), which is a library that can be loaded globally via script tag on a web page, or imported via require or ES6-style imports.

To test how your definition can be used both when referenced globally or as an imported module, create a `test` folder, and place two test files in there.  Name one `YourLibraryName-global.test.ts` and the other `YourLibraryName-module.test.ts`.  The *global* test file should exercise the definition according to how it would be used in a script loaded on a web page where the library is available on the global scope - in this scenario you should not specify an import statement.  The *module* test file should exercise the definition according to how it would be used when imported (including the `import` statement(s)).  If you specify a `files` property in your `tsconfig.json` file, be sure to include both test files.  A [practical example of this](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/big.js/test) is also available on the big.js definition.

Please note that it is not required to fully exercise the definition in each test file - it is sufficient to test only the globally-accessible elements on the global test file and fully exercise the definition in the module test file, or vice versa.

#### What about scoped packages?

Types for a scoped package `@foo/bar` should go in `types/foo__bar`. Note the double underscore.

When `dts-gen` is used to scaffold a scoped package, the `paths` property has to be manually adapted in the generated
`tsconfig.json` to correctly reference the scoped package:

```json
{
    "paths":{
      "@foo/bar": ["foo__bar"]
    }
}
```


#### The file history in GitHub looks incomplete.

GitHub doesn't [support](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5646174/how-to-make-github-follow-directory-history-after-renames) file history for renamed files. Use [`git log --follow`](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-log) instead.

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

**Fast:** Yarn caches every package it has downloaded, so it never needs to download the same package again. It also does almost everything concurrently to maximize resource utilization. This means even faster installs.

**Reliable:** Using a detailed but concise lockfile format and a deterministic algorithm for install operations, Yarn is able to guarantee that any installation that works on one system will work exactly the same on another system.

**Secure:** Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.

## Features

* **Offline Mode.** If you've installed a package before, then you can install it again without an internet connection.
* **Deterministic.** The same dependencies will be installed in the same exact way on any machine, regardless of installation order.
* **Network Performance.** Yarn efficiently queues requests and avoids request waterfalls in order to maximize network utilization.
* **Network Resilience.** A single request that fails will not cause the entire installation to fail. Requests are automatically retried upon failure.
* **Flat Mode.** Yarn resolves mismatched versions of dependencies to a single version to avoid creating duplicates.
* **More emojis.** 🐈

# ADM-ZIP for NodeJS with added support for electron original-fs

ADM-ZIP is a pure JavaScript implementation for zip data compression for [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/). 

# Installation

With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:

    $ npm install adm-zip
	
## What is it good for?
The library allows you to:

* decompress zip files directly to disk or in memory buffers
* compress files and store them to disk in .zip format or in compressed buffers
* update content of/add new/delete files from an existing .zip

# Dependencies
There are no other nodeJS libraries that ADM-ZIP is dependent of

# Examples

## Basic usage
```javascript

	var AdmZip = require('adm-zip');

	// reading archives
	var zip = new AdmZip("./my_file.zip");
	var zipEntries = zip.getEntries(); // an array of ZipEntry records

	zipEntries.forEach(function(zipEntry) {
	    console.log(zipEntry.toString()); // outputs zip entries information
		if (zipEntry.entryName == "my_file.txt") {
		     console.log(zipEntry.getData().toString('utf8')); 
		}
	});
	// outputs the content of some_folder/my_file.txt
	console.log(zip.readAsText("some_folder/my_file.txt")); 
	// extracts the specified file to the specified location
	zip.extractEntryTo(/*entry name*/"some_folder/my_file.txt", /*target path*/"/home/me/tempfolder", /*maintainEntryPath*/false, /*overwrite*/true);
	// extracts everything
	zip.extractAllTo(/*target path*/"/home/me/zipcontent/", /*overwrite*/true);
	
	
	// creating archives
	var zip = new AdmZip();
	
	// add file directly
	var content = "inner content of the file";
	zip.addFile("test.txt", Buffer.alloc(content.length, content), "entry comment goes here");
	// add local file
	zip.addLocalFile("/home/me/some_picture.png");
	// get everything as a buffer
	var willSendthis = zip.toBuffer();
	// or write everything to disk
	zip.writeZip(/*target file name*/"/home/me/files.zip");
	
	
	// ... more examples in the wiki
```

agent-base@4.2.1  MIT  https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS (v4a) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS (v4a) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

The enhancement features `keep alive` `http.Agent`. Support `http` and `https`.

## What's different from original `http.Agent`?

- `keepAlive=true` by default
- Disable Nagle's algorithm: `socket.setNoDelay(true)`
- Add free socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the free-sockets queue.
- Add active socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the active-sockets queue.
- TTL for active socket.

## Node.js version required

Support Node.js >= `8.0.0`

## Install

```bash
$ npm install agentkeepalive --save
```

## new Agent([options])

* `options` {Object} Set of configurable options to set on the agent.
  Can have the following fields:
  * `keepAlive` {Boolean} Keep sockets around in a pool to be used by
    other requests in the future. Default = `true`.
  * `keepAliveMsecs` {Number} When using the keepAlive option, specifies the initial delay
    for TCP Keep-Alive packets. Ignored when the keepAlive option is false or undefined. Defaults to 1000.
    Default = `1000`.  Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
  * `freeSocketTimeout`: {Number} Sets the free socket to timeout
    after `freeSocketTimeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the free socket.
    Default is `15000`.
    Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
  * `timeout`: {Number} Sets the working socket to timeout
    after `timeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the working socket.
    Default is `freeSocketTimeout * 2`.
  * `maxSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets to allow per
    host. Default = `Infinity`.
  * `maxFreeSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets (per host) to leave open
    in a free state. Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.
    Default = `256`.
  * `socketActiveTTL` {Number} Sets the socket active time to live, even if it's in use.
    If not set, the behaviour keeps the same (the socket will be released only when free)
    Default = `null`.

## Usage

```js
const http = require('http');
const Agent = require('agentkeepalive');

const keepaliveAgent = new Agent({
  maxSockets: 100,
  maxFreeSockets: 10,
  timeout: 60000, // active socket keepalive for 60 seconds
  freeSocketTimeout: 30000, // free socket keepalive for 30 seconds
});

const options = {
  host: 'cnodejs.org',
  port: 80,
  path: '/',
  method: 'GET',
  agent: keepaliveAgent,
};

const req = http.request(options, res => {
  console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);
  console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));
  res.setEncoding('utf8');
  res.on('data', function (chunk) {
    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
  });
});
req.on('error', e => {
  console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);
});
req.end();

setTimeout(() => {
  if (keepaliveAgent.statusChanged) {
    console.log('[%s] agent status changed: %j', Date(), keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus());
  }
}, 2000);

```

### `getter agent.statusChanged`

counters have change or not after last checkpoint.

### `agent.getCurrentStatus()`

`agent.getCurrentStatus()` will return a object to show the status of this agent:

```js
{
  createSocketCount: 10,
  closeSocketCount: 5,
  timeoutSocketCount: 0,
  requestCount: 5,
  freeSockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 3 },
  sockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 5 },
  requests: {}
}
```

### Support `https`

```js
const https = require('https');
const HttpsAgent = require('agentkeepalive').HttpsAgent;

const keepaliveAgent = new HttpsAgent();
// https://www.google.com/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
const options = {
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443,
  path: '/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8',
  method: 'GET',
  agent: keepaliveAgent,
};

const req = https.request(options, res => {
  console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);
  console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));
  res.setEncoding('utf8');
  res.on('data', chunk => {
    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);
  });
});

req.on('error', e => {
  console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);
});
req.end();

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('agent status: %j', keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus());
}, 2000);
```

### Support `req.reusedSocket`

This agent implements the `req.reusedSocket` to determine whether a request is send through a reused socket.

When server closes connection at unfortunate time ([keep-alive race](https://code-examples.net/en/q/28a8069)), the http client will throw a `ECONNRESET` error. Under this circumstance, `req.reusedSocket` is useful when we want to retry the request automatically.

```js
const http = require('http');
const Agent = require('agentkeepalive');
const agent = new Agent();

const req = http
  .get('http://localhost:3000', { agent }, (res) => {
    // ...
  })
  .on('error', (err) => {
    if (req.reusedSocket && err.code === 'ECONNRESET') {
      // retry the request or anything else...
    }
  })
```

This behavior is consistent with Node.js core. But through `agentkeepalive`, you can use this feature in older Node.js version.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

asn1.js@4.10.1  MIT  https://github.com/indutny/asn1.js/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ASN1.js

ASN.1 DER Encoder/Decoder and DSL.

## Example

Define model:

```javascript
var asn = require('asn1.js');

var Human = asn.define('Human', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('firstName').octstr(),
    this.key('lastName').octstr(),
    this.key('age').int(),
    this.key('gender').enum({ 0: 'male', 1: 'female' }),
    this.key('bio').seqof(Bio)
  );
});

var Bio = asn.define('Bio', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('time').gentime(),
    this.key('description').octstr()
  );
});
```

Encode data:

```javascript
var output = Human.encode({
  firstName: 'Thomas',
  lastName: 'Anderson',
  age: 28,
  gender: 'male',
  bio: [
    {
      time: +new Date('31 March 1999'),
      description: 'freedom of mind'
    }
  ]
}, 'der');
```

Decode data:

```javascript
var human = Human.decode(output, 'der');
console.log(human);
/*
{ firstName: <Buffer 54 68 6f 6d 61 73>,
  lastName: <Buffer 41 6e 64 65 72 73 6f 6e>,
  age: 28,
  gender: 'male',
  bio:
   [ { time: 922820400000,
       description: <Buffer 66 72 65 65 64 6f 6d 20 6f 66 20 6d 69 6e 64> } ] }
*/
```

### Partial decode

Its possible to parse data without stopping on first error. In order to do it,
you should call:

```javascript
var human = Human.decode(output, 'der', { partial: true });
console.log(human);
/*
{ result: { ... },
  errors: [ ... ] }
*/
```

assert-plus@1.0.0  MIT  https://github.com/mcavage/node-assert-plus/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# assert-plus

This library is a thin wrapper over the Node built-in `assert` module,
providing two main enhancements:

1. the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
   `NODE_NDEBUG`

2. some API wrappers for argument testing; e.g., `assert.string(myArg,
   'myArg')`.  As a simple example:

```javascript
var assert = require('assert-plus');

function fooAccount(options, callback) {
    assert.object(options, 'options');
    assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
    assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
    assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
    assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
    assert.func(callback, 'callback');

    // Do stuff
    callback(null, {});
}
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to submit changes.

## API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
function test(foo) {
    assert.string(foo, 'foo');
}
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
function test(foo) {
    assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
}
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

The complete list of APIs is:

* `assert.array`
* `assert.bool`
* `assert.buffer`
* `assert.func`
* `assert.number`
* `assert.finite`
* `assert.object`
* `assert.string`

* `assert.date`
* `assert.regexp`
* `assert.uuid`
* `assert.arrayOfArray`
* `assert.arrayOfBool`
* `assert.arrayOfBuffer`
* `assert.arrayOfFunc`
* `assert.arrayOfNumber`
* `assert.arrayOfFinite`
* `assert.arrayOfObject`
* `assert.arrayOfString`
* `assert.arrayOfStream`
* `assert.arrayOfDate`
* `assert.arrayOfRegexp`
* `assert.arrayOfUuid`
* `assert.optionalArray`
* `assert.optionalBool`
* `assert.optionalBuffer`
* `assert.optionalFunc`
* `assert.optionalNumber`
* `assert.optionalFinite`
* `assert.optionalObject`
* `assert.optionalString`
* `assert.optionalStream`
* `assert.optionalDate`
* `assert.optionalRegexp`
* `assert.optionalUuid`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfArray`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfBool`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfFunc`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfNumber`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfFinite`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfObject`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfString`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfStream`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfDate`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp`
* `assert.optionalArrayOfUuid`
* `assert.AssertionError`
* `assert.fail`
* `assert.ok`
* `assert.equal`
* `assert.notEqual`
* `assert.deepEqual`
* `assert.notDeepEqual`
* `assert.strictEqual`
* `assert.notStrictEqual`
* `assert.throws`

async-each@1.0.2  MIT  https://github.com/paulmillr/async-each/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# async-each

No-bullshit, ultra-simple, 35-lines-of-code async parallel forEach function for JavaScript.

We don't need junky 30K async libs. Really.

For browsers and node.js.

## Installation
* Just include async-each before your scripts.
* `npm install async-each` if you’re using node.js.

## Usage

* `each(array, iterator, callback);` — `Array`, `Function`, `(optional) Function`
* `iterator(item, next)` receives current item and a callback that will mark the item as done. `next` callback receives optional `error, transformedItem` arguments.
* `callback(error, transformedArray)` optionally receives first error and transformed result `Array`.

```javascript
var each = require('async-each');
each(['a.js', 'b.js', 'c.js'], fs.readFile, function(error, contents) {
  if (error) console.error(error);
  console.log('Contents for a, b and c:', contents);
});

// Alternatively in browser:
asyncEach(list, fn, callback);
```

## Intro

Babel is a tool that helps you write code in the latest version of JavaScript. When your supported environments don't support certain features natively, Babel will help you compile those features down to a supported version.

**In**

```js
// ES2015 arrow function
[1, 2, 3].map((n) => n + 1);
```

**Out**

```js
[1, 2, 3].map(function(n) {
  return n + 1;
});
```

Try it out at our [REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/build/master#?code_lz=NoRgNATGDMC6B0BbAhgBwBQDsAEBeAfNjgNTYgCUA3EA&lineWrap=true&presets=es2015%2Ces2016%2Ces2017&version=7.0.0-beta.2).

# better-assert

  Better c-style assertions using [callsite](https://github.com/visionmedia/callsite) for
  self-documenting failure messages.

## Installation

    $ npm install better-assert

## Example

 By default assertions are enabled, however the __NO_ASSERT__ environment variable 
 will deactivate them when truthy.

```js
var assert = require('better-assert');

test();

function test() {
  var user = { name: 'tobi' };
  assert('tobi' == user.name);
  assert('number' == typeof user.age);
}

AssertionError: 'number' == typeof user.age
    at test (/Users/tj/projects/better-assert/example.js:9:3)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/tj/projects/better-assert/example.js:4:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:449:26)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:467:10)

bn.js@4.11.8  MIT  https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# <img src="./logo.png" alt="bn.js" width="160" height="160" />

> BigNum in pure javascript

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)

## Install
`npm install --save bn.js`

## Usage

```js
const BN = require('bn.js');

var a = new BN('dead', 16);
var b = new BN('101010', 2);

var res = a.add(b);
console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047
```

**Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.

## Notation

### Prefixes

There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here
is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:

* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on
  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs
* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or
  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations
  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be
  added to the result to make it positive

### Postfixes

* `n` - the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript
  Number. Decimals are not supported.
* `rn` - both argument and return value of the function are plain JavaScript
  Numbers. Decimals are not supported.

### Examples

* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`
* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value
* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13

## Instructions

Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be
either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).

### Utilities

* `a.clone()` - clone number
* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes
* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)
* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)
* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero
  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding
* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,
  which must behave like an `Array`
* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For
  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:
  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`
* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied
* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits
  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)
* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied
* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative
* `a.isEven()` - no comments
* `a.isOdd()` - no comments
* `a.isZero()` - no comments
* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)
  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)
* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)
* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)
* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width
* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width
* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance
* `BN.max(a, b)` - return `a` if `a` bigger than `b`
* `BN.min(a, b)` - return `a` if `a` less than `b`

### Arithmetics

* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)
* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)
* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)
* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`
* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)
* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)
* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division

### Bit operations

* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced
  with `andn` in future)
* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`
* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set
* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)
* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number
* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)

### Reduction

* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD
* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)
* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`

## Fast reduction

When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to
use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm
for [Mersenne Prime][1].

### Reduction context

To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:

```js
var red = BN.red(num);
```
where `num` is just a BN instance.

Or:

```js
var red = BN.red(primeName);
```

Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:

* `'k256'`
* `'p224'`
* `'p192'`
* `'p25519'`

Or:

```js
var red = BN.mont(num);
```

To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than
`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.

### Converting numbers

Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted
to it. Usually, this means that one should:

* Convert inputs to reducted ones
* Operate on them in reduction context
* Convert outputs back from the reduction context

Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:

```js
var redA = a.toRed(red);
```
Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above

Here is how to convert them back:

```js
var a = redA.fromRed();
```

### Red instructions

Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their
counterparts in red context:

* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`
* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`
* `a.redShl(num)`
* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`
* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`
* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime
* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number
* `a.redNeg()`
* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation

### Number Size

Optimized for elliptic curves that work with 256-bit numbers.
There is no limitation on the size of the numbers.

# Buffer Alloc Unsafe

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.allocUnsafe`.

Works as Node.js: `v7.0.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-alloc-unsafe
```

## Usage

```js
const allocUnsafe = require('buffer-alloc-unsafe')

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 78 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 05 00>

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 58 ed bf 5f ff 7f 00 00 01 00>

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 50 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 0a 00>

allocUnsafe(-10)
//=> RangeError: "size" argument must not be negative
```

## API

### allocUnsafe(size)

- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`

Allocates a new *non-zero-filled* `Buffer` of `size` bytes. The `size` must be
less than or equal to the value of `buffer.kMaxLength` and greater than or equal
to zero. Otherwise, a `RangeError` is thrown.

Works as Node.js: `v7.0.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh

```

## Usage

```js
const alloc = require('buffer-alloc')

console.log(alloc(4))
//=> <Buffer 00 00 00 00>

console.log(alloc(6, 0x41))
//=> <Buffer 41 41 41 41 41 41>

console.log(alloc(10, 'linus', 'utf8'))
//=> <Buffer 6c 69 6e 75 73 6c 69 6e 75 73>
```

## API

### alloc(size[, fill[, encoding]])

- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`
- `fill` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; A value to pre-fill the new `Buffer` with. **Default:** `0`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `fill` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`

Allocates a new `Buffer` of `size` bytes. If `fill` is `undefined`, the `Buffer` will be zero-filled.

# Buffer Fill

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.fill`.

Works as Node.js: `v6.4.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-fill
```

## Usage

```js
const fill = require('buffer-fill')
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(5)

console.log(buf.fill(8))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 08 08 08>

console.log(buf.fill(9, 2, 4))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 09 09 08>

console.log(buf.fill('linus', 'latin1'))
//=> <Buffer 6c 69 6e 75 73>

console.log(buf.fill('\u0222'))
//=> <Buffer c8 a2 c8 a2 c8>
```

## API

### fill(buf, value[, offset[, end]][, encoding])

- `value` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; The value to fill `buf` with
- `offset` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to start filling `buf`. **Default:** `0`
- `end` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to stop filling `buf` (not inclusive). **Default:** `buf.length`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `value` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`
- Return: &lt;Buffer&gt; A reference to `buf`

Fills `buf` with the specified `value`. If the `offset` and `end` are not given,
the entire `buf` will be filled. This is meant to be a small simplification to
allow the creation and filling of a `Buffer` to be done on a single line.

If the final write of a `fill()` operation falls on a multi-byte character, then
only the first bytes of that character that fit into `buf` are written.

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

> A neat wrapper around Node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / FSEvents.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)

Version 3 is out! Check out our blog post about it: [Chokidar 3: How to save 32TB of traffic every week](https://paulmillr.com/posts/chokidar-3-save-32tb-of-traffic/)

## Why?

Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on MacOS.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.

Initially made for **[Brunch](https://brunch.io/)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](https://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/chokidar).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## How?

Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.

On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
`FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.

On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.

## Getting started

Install with npm:

```sh
npm install chokidar
```

Then `require` and use it in your code:

```javascript
const chokidar = require('chokidar');

// One-liner for current directory
chokidar.watch('.').on('all', (event, path) => {
  console.log(event, path);
});
```

## API

```javascript
// Example of a more typical implementation structure:

// Initialize watcher.
const watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../, // ignore dotfiles
  persistent: true
});

// Something to use when events are received.
const log = console.log.bind(console);
// Add event listeners.
watcher
  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))
  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));

// More possible events.
watcher
  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))
  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))
  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))
  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))
  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => { // internal
    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);
  });

// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second
// argument when available: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {
  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);
});

// Watch new files.
watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);

// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem
var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();

// Un-watch some files.
watcher.unwatch('new-file*');

// Stop watching.
// The method is async!
watcher.close().then(() => console.log('closed'));

// Full list of options. See below for descriptions.
// Do not use this example!
chokidar.watch('file', {
  persistent: true,

  ignored: '*.txt',
  ignoreInitial: false,
  followSymlinks: true,
  cwd: '.',
  disableGlobbing: false,

  usePolling: false,
  interval: 100,
  binaryInterval: 300,
  alwaysStat: false,
  depth: 99,
  awaitWriteFinish: {
    stabilityThreshold: 2000,
    pollInterval: 100
  },

  ignorePermissionErrors: false,
  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)
});

```

`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`

* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.
    - Note: globs must not contain windows separators (`\`),
    because that's how they work by the standard —
    you'll need to replace them with forward slashes (`/`).
    - Note 2: for additional glob documentation, check out low-level
    library: [picomatch](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch).
* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:

#### Persistence

* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.

#### Path filtering

* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[`fs.Stats`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object of that path).
* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).
* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.

#### Performance

* `usePolling` (default: `false`).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is
typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over
a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the
`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)
  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling, in milliseconds. You may also
    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
  polling for binary files.
  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the
`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.
* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.
* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).
By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust
  timing params:*
  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in
  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval, in milliseconds.

#### Errors

* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files
that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`
or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.
* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
"atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event
rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in
milliseconds.

### Methods & Events

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,
`raw`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.  `raw` is internal, use it carefully.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files. Asynchronous, returns Promise.
* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.

## CLI

If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to
execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.

## Install Troubleshooting

* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`
  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is
    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
    Chokidar should function properly.

* `TypeError: fsevents is not a constructor`
  * Update chokidar by doing `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json yarn.lock && npm install`, or update your dependency that uses chokidar.

* Chokidar is producing `ENOSP` error on Linux, like this:
  * `bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device bash: no job control in this shell`
  `Error: watch /home/ ENOSPC`
  * This means Chokidar ran out of file handles and you'll need to increase their count by executing the following command in Terminal:
  `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`

> A neat wrapper around Node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / FSEvents.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)

Version 3 is out! Check out our blog post about it: [Chokidar 3: How to save 32TB of traffic every week](https://paulmillr.com/posts/chokidar-3-save-32tb-of-traffic/)

## Why?

Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on MacOS.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.

Initially made for **[Brunch](https://brunch.io/)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](https://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/chokidar).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## How?

Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.

On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
`FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.

On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.

## Getting started

Install with npm:

```sh
npm install chokidar
```

Then `require` and use it in your code:

```javascript
const chokidar = require('chokidar');

// One-liner for current directory
chokidar.watch('.').on('all', (event, path) => {
  console.log(event, path);
});
```

## API

```javascript
// Example of a more typical implementation structure:

// Initialize watcher.
const watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../, // ignore dotfiles
  persistent: true
});

// Something to use when events are received.
const log = console.log.bind(console);
// Add event listeners.
watcher
  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))
  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));

// More possible events.
watcher
  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))
  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))
  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))
  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))
  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => { // internal
    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);
  });

// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second
// argument when available: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {
  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);
});

// Watch new files.
watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);

// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem
var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();

// Un-watch some files.
watcher.unwatch('new-file*');

// Stop watching.
// The method is async!
watcher.close().then(() => console.log('closed'));

// Full list of options. See below for descriptions.
// Do not use this example!
chokidar.watch('file', {
  persistent: true,

  ignored: '*.txt',
  ignoreInitial: false,
  followSymlinks: true,
  cwd: '.',
  disableGlobbing: false,

  usePolling: false,
  interval: 100,
  binaryInterval: 300,
  alwaysStat: false,
  depth: 99,
  awaitWriteFinish: {
    stabilityThreshold: 2000,
    pollInterval: 100
  },

  ignorePermissionErrors: false,
  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)
});

```

`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`

* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.
    - Note: globs must not contain windows separators (`\`),
    because that's how they work by the standard —
    you'll need to replace them with forward slashes (`/`).
    - Note 2: for additional glob documentation, check out low-level
    library: [picomatch](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch).
* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:

#### Persistence

* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.

#### Path filtering

* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[`fs.Stats`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object of that path).
* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).
* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.

#### Performance

* `usePolling` (default: `false`).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is
typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over
a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the
`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)
  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling, in milliseconds. You may also
    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
  polling for binary files.
  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the
`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.
* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.
* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).
By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust
  timing params:*
  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in
  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval, in milliseconds.

#### Errors

* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files
that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`
or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.
* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
"atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event
rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in
milliseconds.

### Methods & Events

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,
`raw`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.  `raw` is internal, use it carefully.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files. Asynchronous, returns Promise.
* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.

## CLI

If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to
execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.

## Install Troubleshooting

* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`
  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is
    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
    Chokidar should function properly.

* `TypeError: fsevents is not a constructor`
  * Update chokidar by doing `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json yarn.lock && npm install`, or update your dependency that uses chokidar.

* Chokidar is producing `ENOSP` error on Linux, like this:
  * `bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device bash: no job control in this shell`
  `Error: watch /home/ ENOSPC`
  * This means Chokidar ran out of file handles and you'll need to increase their count by executing the following command in Terminal:
  `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`

# codelyzer

A set of tslint rules for static code analysis of Angular TypeScript projects.  
(If you are using [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) check out the new [`angular-eslint`](https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint) repository.

You can run the static code analyzer over web apps, NativeScript, Ionic, etc.

## How to use?

### Angular CLI

[Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io) has support for codelyzer. In order to validate your code with CLI and the custom Angular specific rules just use:

```shell
ng new codelyzer
ng lint
```

Note that by default all components are aligned with the style guide so you won't see any errors in the console.

### Angular Seed

Another project which has out of the box integration with codelyzer is [angular-seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular-seed). In order to run the linter you should:

```shell
# Skip if you've already cloned Angular Seed
git clone https://github.com/mgechev/angular-seed

# Skip if you've already installed all the dependencies of Angular Seed
cd angular-seed && npm i

# Run all the tslint and codelyzer rules
npm run lint
```

Note that by default all components are aligned with the style guide so you won't see any errors in the console.

### Custom Setup

#### Preset

You can use the [`tslint-angular`](https://github.com/mgechev/tslint-angular) preset. All you need is:

```shell
npm i tslint-angular
```

After that create a `tslint.json` file with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": ["tslint-angular"]
}
```

Run the linter with:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/tslint -c tslint.json
```

TSLint will now complain that there are rules which require type checking. In order to fix this, use thw `-p` config option:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/tslint -p tsconfig.json -c tslint.json
```

#### Custom Installation

You can easily use codelyzer with your custom setup:

```shell
npm i codelyzer tslint @angular/compiler @angular/core
```

A. Using codelyzer package in PATH

Create the following `tslint.json` file like:

```json
{
  "extends": ["codelyzer"],
  "rules": {
    "component-class-suffix": true,
    "component-max-inline-declarations": true,
    "component-selector": [true, "element", "sg", "kebab-case"],
    "contextual-lifecycle": true,
    "directive-class-suffix": true,
    "directive-selector": [true, "attribute", "sg", "camelCase"],
    "no-attribute-decorator": true,
    "no-conflicting-lifecycle": true,
    "no-forward-ref": true,
    "no-host-metadata-property": true,
    "no-input-rename": true,
    "no-inputs-metadata-property": true,
    "no-lifecycle-call": true,
    "no-output-native": true,
    "no-output-on-prefix": true,
    "no-output-rename": true,
    "no-outputs-metadata-property": true,
    "no-pipe-impure": true,
    "no-queries-metadata-property": true,
    "no-unused-css": true,
    "prefer-inline-decorator": true,
    "prefer-output-readonly": true,
    "template-banana-in-box": true,
    "template-conditional-complexity": [true, 4],
    "template-cyclomatic-complexity": [true, 5],
    "template-i18n": [true, "check-id", "check-text"],
    "template-no-negated-async": true,
    "template-use-track-by-function": true,
    "use-component-selector": true,
    "use-component-view-encapsulation": true,
    "use-lifecycle-interface": true,
    "use-pipe-transform-interface": true
  }
}
```

To run TSLint with this setup you can use one of the following alternatives:

1.  Install codelyzer globally `npm install -g codelyzer`

2.  Run TSLint from a package.json script by adding a script like `tslint .` to your package.json, similar to:

```json
"scripts": {
  ...
  "lint": "tslint .",
  ...
},
```

Then run `npm run lint`

B. Using codelyzer from node_modules directory

Now create the following `tslint.json` file where your `node_modules` directory is:

```json
{
  "rulesDirectory": ["node_modules/codelyzer"],
  "rules": {
    "component-class-suffix": true,
    "component-max-inline-declarations": true,
    "component-selector": [true, "element", "sg", "kebab-case"],
    "contextual-lifecycle": true,
    "directive-class-suffix": true,
    "directive-selector": [true, "attribute", "sg", "camelCase"],
    "no-attribute-decorator": true,
    "no-conflicting-lifecycle": true,
    "no-forward-ref": true,
    "no-host-metadata-property": true,
    "no-input-rename": true,
    "no-inputs-metadata-property": true,
    "no-lifecycle-call": true,
    "no-output-native": true,
    "no-output-on-prefix": true,
    "no-output-rename": true,
    "no-outputs-metadata-property": true,
    "no-pipe-impure": true,
    "no-queries-metadata-property": true,
    "no-unused-css": true,
    "prefer-inline-decorator": true,
    "prefer-output-readonly": true,
    "template-banana-in-box": true,
    "template-conditional-complexity": [true, 4],
    "template-cyclomatic-complexity": [true, 5],
    "template-i18n": [true, "check-id", "check-text"],
    "template-no-negated-async": true,
    "template-use-track-by-function": true,
    "use-component-selector": true,
    "use-component-view-encapsulation": true,
    "use-lifecycle-interface": true,
    "use-pipe-transform-interface": true
  }
}
```

Next you can create a component file in the same directory with name `component.ts` and the following content:

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'codelyzer',
  template: `
    <h1>Hello {{ name }}!</h1>
  `
})
class Codelyzer {
  name: string = 'World';

  ngOnInit() {
    console.log('Initialized');
  }
}
```

As last step you can execute all the rules against your code with tslint:

```shell
./node_modules/.bin/tslint -c tslint.json component.ts
```

You should see the following output:

```text
component.ts[4, 13]: The selector of the component "Codelyzer" should have prefix "sg" (https://goo.gl/cix8BY)
component.ts[12, 3]: Implement lifecycle hook interface OnInit for method ngOnInit in class Codelyzer (https://goo.gl/w1Nwk3)
component.ts[9, 7]: The name of the class Codelyzer should end with the suffix Component (https://goo.gl/5X1TE7)
```

### Editor Configuration

**Note that you need to have tslint plugin install on your editor**.

Codelyzer should work out of the box with Atom but for VSCode you will have to open `Code > Preferences > User Settings`, and enter the following config:

```json
{
  "tslint.rulesDirectory": "./node_modules/codelyzer",
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib"
}
```

Now you should have the following result:

![VSCode Codelyzer](https://s2.gifyu.com/images/cd357cc648051aadc9.gif)

Enjoy!

## Disable a rule that validates Template or Styles

Lint rules can be disabled by adding a marker in TypeScript files. More information [here](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/).

To disable rules that validate templates or styles you'd need to add a marker in the TypeScript file referencing them.

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

/* tslint:disable:template-use-track-by-function */
@Component({
  selector: 'codelyzer',
  templateUrl: './codelyzer.component.html'
})
class Codelyzer {}
```

## Advanced configuration

Codelyzer supports any template and style language by custom hooks. If you're using Sass for instance, you can allow codelyzer to analyze your styles by creating a file `.codelyzer.js` in the root of your project (where the `node_modules` directory is). In the configuration file can implement custom pre-processing and template resolution logic:

```js
// Demo of transforming Sass styles
var sass = require('node-sass');

module.exports = {
  // Definition of custom interpolation strings
  interpolation: ['{{', '}}'],

  // You can transform the urls of your external styles and templates
  resolveUrl(url, decorator) {
    return url;
  },

  // Transformation of the templates. This hooks is quite useful
  // if you're using any other templating language, for instance
  // jade, markdown, haml, etc.
  //
  // NOTE that this method WILL NOT throw an error in case of invalid template.
  //
  transformTemplate(code, url, decorator) {
    return { code: code, url: url };
  },

  // Transformation of styles. This hook is useful is you're using
  // any other style language, for instance Sass, Less, etc.
  //
  // NOTE that this method WILL NOT throw an error in case of invalid style.
  //
  transformStyle(code, url, decorator) {
    var result = { code: code, url: url };
    if (url && /\.scss$/.test(url)) {
      var transformed = sass.renderSync({ data: code, sourceMap: true, outFile: '/dev/null' });
      result.source = code;
      result.code = transformed.css.toString();
      result.map = transformed.map.toString();
    }
    return result;
  },

  // Custom predefined directives in case you get error for
  // missing property and you are using a template reference
  predefinedDirectives: [{ selector: 'form', exportAs: 'ngForm' }],

  // None = 0b000, Error = 0b001, Info = 0b011, Debug = 0b111
  logLevel: 0b111
};
```

# cssauron

build a matching function in CSS for any nested object structure!

```javascript
var language = require('cssauron')({
    tag: 'tagName'
  , contents: 'innerText'
  , id: 'id'
  , class: 'className'
  , parent: 'parentNode'
  , children: 'childNodes'
  , attr: 'getAttribute(attr)'
})

var selector = language('body > #header .logo')
  , element = document.getElementsByClassName('logo')[0]

if(selector(element)) {
  // element matches selector
} else {
  // element does not match selector
}
```

It's easy to use with your favorite nested tree structures!
Delicious with HTML! Digestable with JSON!

| HTML | JSON | GLSL AST | JS AST (Esprima) |
|------|------|----------|------------------------|
| [cssauron-html](http://npm.im/cssauron-html) | [cssauron-json](http://npm.im/cssauron-json) | [cssauron-glsl](http://npm.im/cssauron-glsl) | [cssauron-falafel](http://npm.im/cssauron-falafel) |


# API

### require('cssauron')(options) -> selector factory

Import `cssauron` and configure it for the nested object structure you'll
want to match against.

#### options

`options` are an object hash of lookup type to string attribute or `function(node)` lookups for queried
nodes. You only need to provide the configuration necessary for the selectors you're planning on creating.
(If you're not going to use `#id` lookups, there's no need to provide the `id` lookup in your options.)

* `tag`: Extract tag information from a node for `div` style selectors.
* `contents`: Extract text information from a node, for `:contains(xxx)` selectors.
* `id`: Extract id for `#my_sweet_id` selectors.
* `class`: `.class_name`
* `parent`: Used to traverse up from the current node, for composite selectors `body #wrapper`, `body > #wrapper`.
* `children`: Used to traverse from a parent to its children for sibling selectors `div + span`, `a ~ p`.
* `attr`: Used to extract attribute information, for `[attr=thing]` style selectors.

### selector_factory('some selector') -> match function

Compiles a matching function.

### match(node) -> false | node | [subjects, ...]

Returns false if the provided node does not match the selector. Returns truthy if the provided
node *does* match. Exact return value is determined by the selector, based on
the [CSS4 subject selector spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors4/#subject): if only
a single node is matched, only that node is returned. If multiple subjects are matched,
a deduplicated array of those subjects are returned.

For example, given the following HTML (and `cssauron-html`):

```html
<div id="gary-busey">
    <p>
        <span class="jake-busey">
        </span>
    </p>
</div>
```

Checking the following selectors against the `span.jake-busey` element yields:

 - `#gary-busey`: `false`, no match.
 - `#gary-busey *`: `span.jake-busey`, a single match.
 - `!#gary-busey *`: `div#gary-busey`, a single match using the `!` subject selector.
 - `#gary-busey *, p span`: `span.jake-busey`, a single match, though both selectors match.
 - `#gary-busey !* !*, !p > !span`: `[p, span.jake-busey]`, two matches.

## Supported pseudoclasses 

 - `:first-child`
 - `:last-child`
 - `:nth-child`
 - `:empty`
 - `:root`
 - `:contains(text)`
 - `:any(selector, selector, selector)`

## Supported attribute lookups

 - `[attr=value]`: Exact match
 - `[attr]`: Attribute exists and is not false-y.
 - `[attr$=value]`: Attribute ends with value
 - `[attr^=value]`: Attribute starts with value
 - `[attr*=value]`: Attribute contains value
 - `[attr~=value]`: Attribute, split by whitespace, contains value.
 - `[attr|=value]`: Attribute, split by `-`, contains value.

cyclist@0.2.2  MIT*  https://github.com/mafintosh/cyclist/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cyclist

Cyclist is an efficient [cyclic list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) implemention for Javascript.
It is available through npm

```
npm install cyclist
```

[![build status](http://img.shields.io/travis/mafintosh/cyclist.svg?style=flat)](http://travis-ci.org/mafintosh/cyclist)

## What?

Cyclist allows you to create a list of fixed size that is cyclic.
In a cyclist list the element following the last one is the first one.
This property can be really useful when for example trying to order data
packets that can arrive out of order over a network stream.

## Usage

``` js
var cyclist = require('cyclist')
var list = cyclist(4)

list.put(42, 'hello 42') // store something and index 42
list.put(43, 'hello 43') // store something and index 43

console.log(list.get(42)) // prints hello 42
console.log(list.get(46)) // prints hello 42 again since 46 - 42 == list.size
```

## API

* `cyclist(size)` creates a new buffer
* `cyclist#get(index)` get an object stored in the buffer
* `cyclist#put(index,value)` insert an object into the buffer
* `cyclist#del(index)` delete an object from an index
* `cyclist#size` property containing current size of buffer

dom-serialize
=============
### Serializes any DOM node into a String

[![Sauce Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/dom-serialize.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/dom-serialize)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/webmodules/dom-serialize.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/webmodules/dom-serialize)

It's like `outerHTML`, but it works with:

 * DOM elements
 * Text nodes
 * Attributes
 * Comment nodes
 * Documents
 * DocumentFragments
 * Doctypes
 * NodeLists / Arrays

For custom serialization logic, a "serialize" event is dispatched on
every `Node` which event listeners can override the default behavior on by
setting the `event.detail.serialize` property to a String or other Node.

The "serialize" event bubbles, so it could be a good idea to utilize
event delegation on a known root node that will be serialized.
Check the `event.serializeTarget` property to check which `Node` is
currently being serialized.


Installation
------------

``` bash
$ npm install dom-serialize
```


Example
-------

``` js
var serialize = require('dom-serialize');
var node;

// works with Text nodes
node = document.createTextNode('foo & <bar>');
console.log(serialize(node));


// works with DOM elements
node = document.createElement('body');
node.appendChild(document.createElement('strong'));
node.firstChild.appendChild(document.createTextNode('hello'));
console.log(serialize(node));


// custom "serialize" event
node.firstChild.addEventListener('serialize', function (event) {
  event.detail.serialize = 'pwn';
}, false);
console.log(serialize(node));


// you can also just pass a function in for a one-time serializer
console.log(serialize(node, function (event) {
  if (event.serializeTarget === node.firstChild) {
    // for the first child, output an ellipsis to summarize "content"
    event.detail.serialze = '…';
  } else if (event.serializeTarget !== node) {
    // any other child
    event.preventDefault();
  }
}));
```

```
foo &amp; &lt;bar&gt;
<body><strong>hello</strong></body>
<body>pwn</body>
<body>…</body>
```

[![Saucelabs Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/gh-indutny-elliptic.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/gh-indutny-elliptic)

Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.

## Incentive

ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.

## Benchmarks

```bash
$ node benchmarks/index.js
Benchmarking: sign
elliptic#sign x 262 ops/sec ±0.51% (177 runs sampled)
eccjs#sign x 55.91 ops/sec ±0.90% (144 runs sampled)
------------------------
Fastest is elliptic#sign
========================
Benchmarking: verify
elliptic#verify x 113 ops/sec ±0.50% (166 runs sampled)
eccjs#verify x 48.56 ops/sec ±0.36% (125 runs sampled)

## API

### ECDSA

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;

// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');

// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash);

// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

var pubPoint = key.getPublic();
var x = pubPoint.getX();
var y = pubPoint.getY();

// Public Key MUST be either:
// 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or
// 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or
// 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y)
var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1
var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2
var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3
var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3

// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or
// 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)

var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### EdDSA

```javascript
var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;

// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');

// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Import public key
var pub = '0a1af638...';
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
var signature = '70bed1...';
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### ECDH

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();

var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());

console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
```

three and more members:
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();

var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())

var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())

console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
```

NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.

## Supported curves

Elliptic.js support following curve types:

* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards

Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:

* `secp256k1`
* `p192`
* `p224`
* `p256`
* `p384`
* `p521`
* `curve25519`
* `ed25519`

NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.

### Implementation details

ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.

All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]

### Related projects

* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

Create new error instances with a code and additional properties.


## Installation

```console
$ npm install err-code
// or
$ bower install err-code
```

The browser file is named index.umd.js which supports CommonJS, AMD and globals (errCode).


## Why

I find myself doing this repeatedly:

```js
var err = new Error('My message');
err.code = 'SOMECODE';
err.detail = 'Additional information about the error';
throw err;
```


## Usage

Simple usage.

```js
var errcode = require('err-code');

// fill error with message + code
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), 'ESOMECODE');
// fill error with message + code + props
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), 'ESOMECODE', { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
// fill error with message + props
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
```


## Tests

`$ npm test`

## errno exposed

Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.

**By errno:**

```js
require('errno').errno[3]
// → {
//     "errno": 3,
//     "code": "EACCES",
//     "description": "permission denied"
//   }
```

**By code:**

```js
require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY
// → {
//     "errno": 53,
//     "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
//     "description": "directory not empty"
//   }
```

**Make your errors more descriptive:**

```js
var errno = require('errno')

function errmsg(err) {
  var str = 'Error: '
  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message

  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
  if (err.path)
    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'

  return str
}

var fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
```

**Use as a command line tool:**

```
~ $ errno 53
{
  "errno": 53,
  "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
  "description": "directory not empty"
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  "errno": 56,
  "code": "EROFS",
  "description": "read-only file system"
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: "foo"
```

Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.

You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.

<a name="customerrors"></a>
## Custom errors

Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.

```js
var create = require('errno').custom.createError
var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)

// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')

if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
```

Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:

```js
fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
```

The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

es6-promisify@5.0.0  MIT  https://github.com/digitaldesignlabs/es6-promisify/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/digitaldesignlabs/es6-promisify.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/digitaldesignlabs/es6-promisify)

# es6-promisify
Converts callback-based functions to ES6/ES2015 Promises, using a boilerplate callback function.

NOTE: All-new API for Version 6.0.0; please read carefully!
===========================================================

## Install
Install with [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/es6-promisify)

```bash
npm install es6-promisify
```

## Example
```js
const {promisify} = require("es6-promisify");

// Convert the stat function
const fs = require("fs");
const stat = promisify(fs.stat);

// Now usable as a promise!
stat("example.txt").then(function (stats) {
    console.log("Got stats", stats);
}).catch(function (err) {
    console.error("Yikes!", err);
});
```

## Promisify methods
```js
const {promisify} = require("es6-promisify");

// Create a promise-based version of send_command
const redis = require("redis").createClient(6379, "localhost");
const client = promisify(redis.send_command.bind(redis));

// Send commands to redis and get a promise back
client("ping").then(function (pong) {
    console.log("Got", pong);
}).catch(function (err) {
    console.error("Unexpected error", err);
}).then(function () {
    redis.quit();
});
```

## Handle multiple callback arguments, with named parameters
```js
const {promisify} = require("es6-promisify");

function test(cb) {
    return cb(undefined, 1, 2, 3);
}

// Create promise-based version of test
test[promisify.argumentNames] = ["one", "two", "three"];
const multi = promisify(test);

// Returns named arguments
multi().then(result => {
    console.log(result); // {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3}
});
```

## Provide your own Promise implementation
```js
const {promisify} = require("es6-promisify");

// Now uses Bluebird
promisify.Promise = require("bluebird");

const test = promisify(cb => cb(undefined, "test"));
test().then(result => {
    console.log(result); // "test", resolved using Bluebird
});
```

### Tests
Test with tape
```bash
$ npm test
```

### Changes from v5.0.0
- Allow developer to specify a different implementations of `Promise`
- No longer ships with a polyfill for `Promise`. If your environment has no native `Promise` you must polyfill yourself, or set `promisify.Promise` to an A+ compatible `Promise` implementation.
- Removed support for `settings.thisArg`: use `.bind()` instead.
- Removed support for `settings.multiArgs`: use named arguments instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
esrecurse@4.2.1  BSD-2-Clause  https://github.com/estools/esrecurse/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)

Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is
[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
recursive traversing functionality.

### Example Usage

The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(ast, {
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});
```

We can use `Visitor` instance.

```javascript
var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});

visitor.visit(ast);
```

We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.

```javascript
class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {
    constructor()
    {
        super(null);
    }

    XXXStatement(node) {
    }
}
```

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    this.visit(node.left);
    // do something...
    this.visit(node.right);
};
```

And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    // do something...
    this.visitChildren(node);
};
```

The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`.
We can use user-defined node types.

```javascript
// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
var tree = {
    type: 'TestExpression',

    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: 20
    },

    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        // Extending the existing traversing rules.
        childVisitorKeys: {
            // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]
            TestExpression: ['argument']
        }
    }
);
```

We can use the `fallback` option as well.
If the `fallback` option is `"iteration"`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: 'iteration'
    }
);
```

If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: function (node) {
            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {
                return key !== 'argument'
            });
        }
    }
);
```

faye-websocket@0.10.0  MIT  https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-node/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# faye-websocket [![Build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node)

This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the
[Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project. It provides classes for easily building
WebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but
rather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing
[Node](https://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction
other than the standard [WebSocket
API](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#network).

It also provides an abstraction for handling
[EventSource](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#server-sent-events)
connections, which are one-way connections that allow the server to push data to
the client. They are based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access
via proxies than WebSockets.


## Installation

```
$ npm install faye-websocket
```


## Handling WebSocket connections in Node

You can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade
requests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes
the usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this
is how you'd implement an echo server:

```js
var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),
    http      = require('http');

var server = http.createServer();

server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {
  if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {
    var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);

    ws.on('message', function(event) {
      ws.send(event.data);
    });

    ws.on('close', function(event) {
      console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);
      ws = null;
    });
  }
});

server.listen(8000);
```

`WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the
`ws.on('message', ...)` line with:

```js
    ws.pipe(ws);
```

Note that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting
through an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you
call `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire
handshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer
the message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any
buffered messages will be sent to the client.

If you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the
`onopen` event.

If the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to
send a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a
message string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message
is received. It returns `true` if and only if a ping message was sent. If the
client does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns
`false`.

```js
ws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {
  // fires when pong is received
});
```


## Using the WebSocket client

The client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss`
protocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web
browser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.

```js
var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),
    ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');

ws.on('open', function(event) {
  console.log('open');
  ws.send('Hello, world!');
});

ws.on('message', function(event) {
  console.log('message', event.data);
});

ws.on('close', function(event) {
  console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);
  ws = null;
});
```

The WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the
handshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.

To connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy,
including any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you
require. Only the `origin` setting is required.

```js
var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', [], {
  proxy: {
    origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',
    headers: { 'User-Agent': 'node' },
    tls:     { cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt') }
  }
});
```

The `tls` value is an object that will be passed to
[`tls.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).


## Subprotocol negotiation

The WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application
protocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which
protocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you
construct the socket:

```js
var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']);
```

On the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server
supports after the other constructor arguments:

```js
var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']);
```

If the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side
socket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.


## Protocol extensions

faye-websocket is based on the
[websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)
framework that allows extensions to be negotiated via the
`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. To add extensions to a connection, pass an
array of extensions to the `:extensions` option. For example, to add
[permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node):

```js
var deflate = require('permessage-deflate');

var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, [], { extensions: [deflate] });
```


## Initialization options

Both the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in
at initialization time, for example:

```js
var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options);
var ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options);
```

`protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`.
`options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:

- `extensions` - an array of
  [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)
  compatible extensions, as described above
- `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to
  be sent during the handshake process
- `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.
  The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB.
- `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping frames,
  measured in seconds

The client accepts some additional options:

- `proxy` - settings for a proxy as described above
- `net` - an object containing settings for the origin server that will be
  passed to
  [`net.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_connect_options_connectlistener)
- `tls` - an object containing TLS settings for the origin server, this will be
  passed to
  [`tls.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback)
- `ca` - (legacy) a shorthand for passing `{ tls: { ca: value } }`


## WebSocket API

Both server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.

- **`on('open', function(event) {})`** fires when the socket connection is
  established. Event has no attributes.
- **`on('message', function(event) {})`** fires when the socket receives a
  message. Event has one attribute, **`data`**, which is either a `String` (for
  text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames).
- **`on('error', function(event) {})`** fires when there is a protocol error due
  to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational, you do
  not need to implement error recover.
- **`on('close', function(event) {})`** fires when either the client or the
  server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, **`code`**
  and **`reason`**, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer
  that closed the connection.
- **`send(message)`** accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a text
  or binary message over the connection to the other peer.
- **`ping(message, function() {})`** sends a ping frame with an optional message
  and fires the callback when a matching pong is received.
- **`close(code, reason)`** closes the connection, sending the given status code
  and reason text, both of which are optional.
- **`version`** is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket` protocol
  the connection is using.
- **`protocol`** is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol
  the socket is using.


## Handling EventSource connections in Node

EventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they
only allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API.
EventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each
message has an optional event-type and ID.

```js
var WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),
    EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,
    http        = require('http');

var server = http.createServer();

server.on('request', function(request, response) {
  if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {
    var es = new EventSource(request, response);
    console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);

    // Periodically send messages
    var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);

    es.on('close', function() {
      clearInterval(loop);
      es = null;
    });

  } else {
    // Normal HTTP request
    response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    response.end('Hello');
  }
});

server.listen(8000);
```

The `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default
event-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification`
event with ID `99`:

```js
es.send('Breaking News!', { event: 'notification', id: '99' });
```

The `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:

- **`url`** is a string containing the URL the client used to create the
  EventSource.
- **`lastEventId`** is a string containing the last event ID received by the
  client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection
  to determine which messages need resending.

When you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass
configuration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:

- **`headers`** is an object containing custom headers to be set on the
  EventSource response.
- **`retry`** is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it should
  wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect.
- **`ping`** is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send
  'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts
  set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.

For example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings
every 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:

```js
var es = new EventSource(request, response, {
  headers: { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*' },
  ping:    15,
  retry:   10
});
```

You can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike
WebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send
some data over the wire to keep the connection alive.

# Font Awesome unicode bindings
Get a [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) unicode character by the icon name.  
Especially useful for outputting to e.g. terminals with a [Font Awesome patched font](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts) or for [Lemonbar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lemonbar), but I'm sure you'll think of even better use cases.

## Usage:
```javascript
var fa = require("fontawesome");
console.log(fa("fort-awesome") + " Hello World!"); // Hello World!
console.log(fa.fortAwesome + " Hello World!"); // Hello World!
```

http-cache-semantics@3.8.1  BSD-2-Clause  https://github.com/pornel/http-cache-semantics/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Can I cache this? [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kornelski/http-cache-semantics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kornelski/http-cache-semantics)

`CachePolicy` tells when responses can be reused from a cache, taking into account [HTTP RFC 7234](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) rules for user agents and shared caches. It's aware of many tricky details such as the `Vary` header, proxy revalidation, and authenticated responses.

## Usage

Cacheability of an HTTP response depends on how it was requested, so both `request` and `response` are required to create the policy.

```js
const policy = new CachePolicy(request, response, options);

if (!policy.storable()) {
    // throw the response away, it's not usable at all
    return;
}

// Cache the data AND the policy object in your cache
// (this is pseudocode, roll your own cache (lru-cache package works))
letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.set(
    request.url,
    { policy, response },
    policy.timeToLive()
);
```

```js
// And later, when you receive a new request:
const { policy, response } = letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.get(newRequest.url);

// It's not enough that it exists in the cache, it has to match the new request, too:
if (policy && policy.satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)) {
    // OK, the previous response can be used to respond to the `newRequest`.
    // Response headers have to be updated, e.g. to add Age and remove uncacheable headers.
    response.headers = policy.responseHeaders();
    return response;
}
```

It may be surprising, but it's not enough for an HTTP response to be [fresh](#yo-fresh) to satisfy a request. It may need to match request headers specified in `Vary`. Even a matching fresh response may still not be usable if the new request restricted cacheability, etc.

The key method is `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)`, which checks whether the `newRequest` is compatible with the original request and whether all caching conditions are met.

### Constructor options

Request and response must have a `headers` property with all header names in lower case. `url`, `status` and `method` are optional (defaults are any URL, status `200`, and `GET` method).

```js
const request = {
    url: '/',
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        accept: '*/*',
    },
};

const response = {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
        'cache-control': 'public, max-age=7234',
    },
};

const options = {
    shared: true,
    cacheHeuristic: 0.1,
    immutableMinTimeToLive: 24 * 3600 * 1000, // 24h
    ignoreCargoCult: false,
    trustServerDate: true,
};
```

If `options.shared` is `true` (default), then the response is evaluated from a perspective of a shared cache (i.e. `private` is not cacheable and `s-maxage` is respected). If `options.shared` is `false`, then the response is evaluated from a perspective of a single-user cache (i.e. `private` is cacheable and `s-maxage` is ignored). `shared: true` is recommended for HTTP clients.

`options.cacheHeuristic` is a fraction of response's age that is used as a fallback cache duration. The default is 0.1 (10%), e.g. if a file hasn't been modified for 100 days, it'll be cached for 100\*0.1 = 10 days.

`options.immutableMinTimeToLive` is a number of milliseconds to assume as the default time to cache responses with `Cache-Control: immutable`. Note that [per RFC](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/immutable.html) these can become stale, so `max-age` still overrides the default.

If `options.ignoreCargoCult` is true, common anti-cache directives will be completely ignored if the non-standard `pre-check` and `post-check` directives are present. These two useless directives are most commonly found in bad StackOverflow answers and PHP's "session limiter" defaults.

If `options.trustServerDate` is false, then server's `Date` header won't be used as the base for `max-age`. This is against the RFC, but it's useful if you want to cache responses with very short `max-age`, but your local clock is not exactly in sync with the server's.

### `storable()`

Returns `true` if the response can be stored in a cache. If it's `false` then you MUST NOT store either the request or the response.

### `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)`

This is the most important method. Use this method to check whether the cached response is still fresh in the context of the new request.

If it returns `true`, then the given `request` matches the original response this cache policy has been created with, and the response can be reused without contacting the server. Note that the old response can't be returned without being updated, see `responseHeaders()`.

If it returns `false`, then the response may not be matching at all (e.g. it's for a different URL or method), or may require to be refreshed first (see `revalidationHeaders()`).

### `responseHeaders()`

Returns updated, filtered set of response headers to return to clients receiving the cached response. This function is necessary, because proxies MUST always remove hop-by-hop headers (such as `TE` and `Connection`) and update response's `Age` to avoid doubling cache time.

```js
cachedResponse.headers = cachePolicy.responseHeaders(cachedResponse);
```

### `timeToLive()`

Returns approximate time in _milliseconds_ until the response becomes stale (i.e. not fresh).

After that time (when `timeToLive() <= 0`) the response might not be usable without revalidation. However, there are exceptions, e.g. a client can explicitly allow stale responses, so always check with `satisfiesWithoutRevalidation()`.

### `toObject()`/`fromObject(json)`

Chances are you'll want to store the `CachePolicy` object along with the cached response. `obj = policy.toObject()` gives a plain JSON-serializable object. `policy = CachePolicy.fromObject(obj)` creates an instance from it.

### Refreshing stale cache (revalidation)

When a cached response has expired, it can be made fresh again by making a request to the origin server. The server may respond with status 304 (Not Modified) without sending the response body again, saving bandwidth.

The following methods help perform the update efficiently and correctly.

#### `revalidationHeaders(newRequest)`

Returns updated, filtered set of request headers to send to the origin server to check if the cached response can be reused. These headers allow the origin server to return status 304 indicating the response is still fresh. All headers unrelated to caching are passed through as-is.

Use this method when updating cache from the origin server.

```js
updateRequest.headers = cachePolicy.revalidationHeaders(updateRequest);
```

#### `revalidatedPolicy(revalidationRequest, revalidationResponse)`

Use this method to update the cache after receiving a new response from the origin server. It returns an object with two keys:

-   `policy` — A new `CachePolicy` with HTTP headers updated from `revalidationResponse`. You can always replace the old cached `CachePolicy` with the new one.
-   `modified` — Boolean indicating whether the response body has changed.
    -   If `false`, then a valid 304 Not Modified response has been received, and you can reuse the old cached response body.
    -   If `true`, you should use new response's body (if present), or make another request to the origin server without any conditional headers (i.e. don't use `revalidationHeaders()` this time) to get the new resource.

```js
// When serving requests from cache:
const { oldPolicy, oldResponse } = letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.get(
    newRequest.url
);

if (!oldPolicy.satisfiesWithoutRevalidation(newRequest)) {
    // Change the request to ask the origin server if the cached response can be used
    newRequest.headers = oldPolicy.revalidationHeaders(newRequest);

    // Send request to the origin server. The server may respond with status 304
    const newResponse = await makeRequest(newRequest);

    // Create updated policy and combined response from the old and new data
    const { policy, modified } = oldPolicy.revalidatedPolicy(
        newRequest,
        newResponse
    );
    const response = modified ? newResponse : oldResponse;

    // Update the cache with the newer/fresher response
    letsPretendThisIsSomeCache.set(
        newRequest.url,
        { policy, response },
        policy.timeToLive()
    );

    // And proceed returning cached response as usual
    response.headers = policy.responseHeaders();
    return response;
}
```

https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

# ignore

`ignore` is a manager, filter and parser which implemented in pure JavaScript according to the [.gitignore spec 2.22.1](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

`ignore` is used by eslint, gitbook and [many others](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/ignore).

Pay attention that [`minimatch`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/minimatch) does not work in the gitignore way. To filter filenames according to .gitignore file, I recommend this module.

### Tested on

`ignore` is fully tested, and has more than **five hundreds** of unit tests.

- Linux + Node: `0.8` - `7.x`
- Windows + Node: `0.10` - `7.x`, node < `0.10` is not tested due to the lack of support of appveyor.

Actually, `ignore` does not rely on any versions of node specially.

Since `4.0.0`, ignore will no longer support `node < 6` by default, to use in node < 6, `require('ignore/legacy')`. For details, see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kaelzhang/node-ignore/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Table Of Main Contents

- [Usage](#usage)
- [`Pathname` Conventions](#pathname-conventions)
- See Also:
  - [`glob-gitignore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-gitignore) matches files using patterns and filters them according to gitignore rules.
- [Upgrade Guide](#upgrade-guide)

## Install

```sh
npm i ignore
```

## Usage

```js
import ignore from 'ignore'
const ig = ignore().add(['.abc/*', '!.abc/d/'])
```

### Filter the given paths

```js
const paths = [
  '.abc/a.js',    // filtered out
  '.abc/d/e.js'   // included
]

ig.filter(paths)        // ['.abc/d/e.js']
ig.ignores('.abc/a.js') // true
```

### As the filter function

```js
paths.filter(ig.createFilter()); // ['.abc/d/e.js']
```

### Win32 paths will be handled

```js
ig.filter(['.abc\\a.js', '.abc\\d\\e.js'])
// if the code above runs on windows, the result will be
// ['.abc\\d\\e.js']
```

## Why another ignore?

- `ignore` is a standalone module, and is much simpler so that it could easy work with other programs, unlike [isaacs](https://npmjs.org/~isaacs)'s [fstream-ignore](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream-ignore) which must work with the modules of the fstream family.

- `ignore` only contains utility methods to filter paths according to the specified ignore rules, so
  - `ignore` never try to find out ignore rules by traversing directories or fetching from git configurations.
  - `ignore` don't cares about sub-modules of git projects.

- Exactly according to [gitignore man page](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), fixes some known matching issues of fstream-ignore, such as:
  - '`/*.js`' should only match '`a.js`', but not '`abc/a.js`'.
  - '`**/foo`' should match '`foo`' anywhere.
  - Prevent re-including a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.
  - Handle trailing whitespaces:
    - `'a '`(one space) should not match `'a  '`(two spaces).
    - `'a \ '` matches `'a  '`
  - All test cases are verified with the result of `git check-ignore`.

# Methods

## .add(pattern: string | Ignore): this
## .add(patterns: Array<string | Ignore>): this

- **pattern** `String | Ignore` An ignore pattern string, or the `Ignore` instance
- **patterns** `Array<String | Ignore>` Array of ignore patterns.

Adds a rule or several rules to the current manager.

Returns `this`

Notice that a line starting with `'#'`(hash) is treated as a comment. Put a backslash (`'\'`) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash, if you want to ignore a file with a hash at the beginning of the filename.

```js
ignore().add('#abc').ignores('#abc')    // false
ignore().add('\#abc').ignores('#abc')   // true
```

`pattern` could either be a line of ignore pattern or a string of multiple ignore patterns, which means we could just `ignore().add()` the content of a ignore file:

```js
ignore()
.add(fs.readFileSync(filenameOfGitignore).toString())
.filter(filenames)
```

`pattern` could also be an `ignore` instance, so that we could easily inherit the rules of another `Ignore` instance.

## <strike>.addIgnoreFile(path)</strike>

REMOVED in `3.x` for now.

To upgrade `ignore@2.x` up to `3.x`, use

```js
import fs from 'fs'

if (fs.existsSync(filename)) {
  ignore().add(fs.readFileSync(filename).toString())
}
```

instead.

## .filter(paths: Array&lt;Pathname&gt;): Array&lt;Pathname&gt;

```ts
type Pathname = string
```

Filters the given array of pathnames, and returns the filtered array.

- **paths** `Array.<Pathname>` The array of `pathname`s to be filtered.

### `Pathname` Conventions:

#### 1. `Pathname` should be a `path.relative()`d pathname

`Pathname` should be a string that have been `path.join()`ed, or the return value of `path.relative()` to the current directory,

```js
// WRONG, an error will be thrown
ig.ignores('./abc')

// WRONG, for it will never happen, and an error will be thrown
// If the gitignore rule locates at the root directory,
// `'/abc'` should be changed to `'abc'`.
// ```
// path.relative('/', '/abc')  -> 'abc'
// ```
ig.ignores('/abc')

// WRONG, that it is an absolute path on Windows, an error will be thrown
ig.ignores('C:\\abc')

// Right
ig.ignores('abc')

// Right
ig.ignores(path.join('./abc'))  // path.join('./abc') -> 'abc'
```

In other words, each `Pathname` here should be a relative path to the directory of the gitignore rules.

Suppose the dir structure is:

```
/path/to/your/repo
    |-- a
    |   |-- a.js
    |
    |-- .b
    |
    |-- .c
         |-- .DS_store
```

Then the `paths` might be like this:

```js
[
  'a/a.js'
  '.b',
  '.c/.DS_store'
]
```

#### 2. filenames and dirnames

`node-ignore` does NO `fs.stat` during path matching, so for the example below:

```js
// First, we add a ignore pattern to ignore a directory
ig.add('config/')

// `ig` does NOT know if 'config', in the real world,
//   is a normal file, directory or something.

ig.ignores('config')
// `ig` treats `config` as a file, so it returns `false`

ig.ignores('config/')
// returns `true`
```

Specially for people who develop some library based on `node-ignore`, it is important to understand that.

Usually, you could use [`glob`](http://npmjs.org/package/glob) with `option.mark = true` to fetch the structure of the current directory:

```js
import glob from 'glob'

glob('**', {
  // Adds a / character to directory matches.
  mark: true
}, (err, files) => {
  if (err) {
    return console.error(err)
  }

  let filtered = ignore().add(patterns).filter(files)
  console.log(filtered)
})
```

## .ignores(pathname: Pathname): boolean

> new in 3.2.0

Returns `Boolean` whether `pathname` should be ignored.

```js
ig.ignores('.abc/a.js')    // true
```

## .createFilter()

Creates a filter function which could filter an array of paths with `Array.prototype.filter`.

Returns `function(path)` the filter function.

## .test(pathname: Pathname) since 5.0.0

Returns `TestResult`

```ts
interface TestResult {
  ignored: boolean
  // true if the `pathname` is finally unignored by some negative pattern
  unignored: boolean
}
```

- `{ignored: true, unignored: false}`: the `pathname` is ignored
- `{ignored: false, unignored: true}`: the `pathname` is unignored
- `{ignored: false, unignored: false}`: the `pathname` is never matched by any ignore rules.

## `options.ignorecase` since 4.0.0

Similar as the `core.ignorecase` option of [git-config](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config), `node-ignore` will be case insensitive if `options.ignorecase` is set to `true` (the default value), otherwise case sensitive.

```js
const ig = ignore({
  ignorecase: false
})

ig.add('*.png')

ig.ignores('*.PNG')  // false
```

## static `ignore.isPathValid(pathname): boolean` since 5.0.0

Check whether the `pathname` is valid according to the [convention](#1-pathname-should-be-a-pathrelatived-pathname).

```js
ignore.isPathValid('./foo')  // false
```

****

# Upgrade Guide

## Upgrade 4.x -> 5.x

Since `5.0.0`, if an invalid `Pathname` passed into `ig.ignores()`, an error will be thrown, while `ignore < 5.0.0` did not make sure what the return value was, as well as

```ts
.ignores(pathname: Pathname): boolean

.filter(pathnames: Array<Pathname>): Array<Pathname>

.createFilter(): (pathname: Pathname) => boolean

.test(pathname: Pathname): {ignored: boolean, unignored: boolean}
```

See the convention [here](#1-pathname-should-be-a-pathrelatived-pathname) for details.

If there are invalid pathnames, the conversion and filtration should be done by users.

```js
import {isPathValid} from 'ignore' // introduced in 5.0.0

const paths = [
  // invalid
  //////////////////
  '',
  false,
  '../foo',
  '.',
  //////////////////

  // valid
  'foo'
]
.filter(isValidPath)

ig.filter(paths)
```

## Upgrade 3.x -> 4.x

Since `4.0.0`, `ignore` will no longer support node < 6, to use `ignore` in node < 6:

```js
var ignore = require('ignore/legacy')
```

## Upgrade 2.x -> 3.x

- All `options` of 2.x are unnecessary and removed, so just remove them.
- `ignore()` instance is no longer an [`EventEmitter`](nodejs.org/api/events.html), and all events are unnecessary and removed.
- `.addIgnoreFile()` is removed, see the [.addIgnoreFile](#addignorefilepath) section for details.

imurmurhash@0.1.4  MIT  https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

## Goal and Philosophy

**`Inquirer.js`** strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and perhaps the "CLI [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane)").

**`Inquirer.js`** should ease the process of

- providing _error feedback_
- _asking questions_
- _parsing_ input
- _validating_ answers
- managing _hierarchical prompts_

> **Note:** **`Inquirer.js`** provides the user interface and the inquiry session flow. If you're searching for a full blown command line program utility, then check out [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js), [vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal) or [args](https://github.com/leo/args).

## [Documentation](#documentation)

<a name="documentation"></a>

### Installation

<a name="installation"></a>

```shell
npm install inquirer
```

```javascript
var inquirer = require('inquirer');
inquirer
  .prompt([
    /* Pass your questions in here */
  ])
  .then(answers => {
    // Use user feedback for... whatever!!
  });
```

<a name="examples"></a>

### Examples (Run it and see it)

Check out the [`packages/inquirer/examples/`](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/tree/master/packages/inquirer/examples) folder for code and interface examples.

```shell
node packages/inquirer/examples/pizza.js
node packages/inquirer/examples/checkbox.js
# etc...
```

### Methods

<a name="methods"></a>

#### `inquirer.prompt(questions) -> promise`

Launch the prompt interface (inquiry session)

- **questions** (Array) containing [Question Object](#question) (using the [reactive interface](#reactive-interface), you can also pass a `Rx.Observable` instance)
- returns a **Promise**

#### `inquirer.registerPrompt(name, prompt)`

Register prompt plugins under `name`.

- **name** (string) name of the this new prompt. (used for question `type`)
- **prompt** (object) the prompt object itself (the plugin)

#### `inquirer.createPromptModule() -> prompt function`

Create a self contained inquirer module. If you don't want to affect other libraries that also rely on inquirer when you overwrite or add new prompt types.

```js
var prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();

prompt(questions).then(/* ... */);
```

### Objects

<a name="objects"></a>

#### Question

<a name="questions"></a>
A question object is a `hash` containing question related values:

- **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `number`, `confirm`,
  `list`, `rawlist`, `expand`, `checkbox`, `password`, `editor`
- **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash. If the name contains periods, it will define a path in the answers hash.
- **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers. Defaults to the value of `name` (followed by a colon).
- **default**: (String|Number|Boolean|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
  Array values can be simple `numbers`, `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator).
- **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and answers hash. Should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided.
- **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash.
- **transformer**: (Function) Receive the user input, answers hash and option flags, and return a transformed value to display to the user. The transformation only impacts what is shown while editing. It does not modify the answers hash.
- **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean.
- **pageSize**: (Number) Change the number of lines that will be rendered when using `list`, `rawList`, `expand` or `checkbox`.
- **prefix**: (String) Change the default _prefix_ message.
- **suffix**: (String) Change the default _suffix_ message.

`default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronously. Either return a promise or use `this.async()` to get a callback you'll call with the final value.

```javascript
{
  /* Preferred way: with promise */
  filter() {
    return new Promise(/* etc... */);
  },

  /* Legacy way: with this.async */
  validate: function (input) {
    // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback
    var done = this.async();

    // Do async stuff
    setTimeout(function() {
      if (typeof input !== 'number') {
        // Pass the return value in the done callback
        done('You need to provide a number');
        return;
      }
      // Pass the return value in the done callback
      done(null, true);
    }, 3000);
  }
}
```

### Answers

<a name="answers"></a>
A key/value hash containing the client answers in each prompt.

- **Key** The `name` property of the _question_ object
- **Value** (Depends on the prompt)
  - `confirm`: (Boolean)
  - `input` : User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (String)
  - `number`: User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (Number)
  - `rawlist`, `list` : Selected choice value (or name if no value specified) (String)

### Separator

<a name="separator"></a>
A separator can be added to any `choices` array:

```
// In the question object
choices: [ "Choice A", new inquirer.Separator(), "choice B" ]

// Which'll be displayed this way
[?] What do you want to do?
 > Order a pizza
   Make a reservation
   --------
   Ask opening hours
   Talk to the receptionist
```

The constructor takes a facultative `String` value that'll be use as the separator. If omitted, the separator will be `--------`.

Separator instances have a property `type` equal to `separator`. This should allow tools façading Inquirer interface from detecting separator types in lists.

<a name="prompt"></a>

### Prompt types

---

> **Note:**: _allowed options written inside square brackets (`[]`) are optional. Others are required._

#### List - `{type: 'list'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array or a choice `value`)

![List prompt](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/list.svg)

---

#### Raw List - `{type: 'rawlist'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array)

![Raw list prompt](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/rawlist.svg)

---

#### Expand - `{type: 'expand'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array. If `default` key not provided, then `help` will be used as default choice)

Note that the `choices` object will take an extra parameter called `key` for the `expand` prompt. This parameter must be a single (lowercased) character. The `h` option is added by the prompt and shouldn't be defined by the user.

See `examples/expand.js` for a running example.

![Expand prompt closed](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/expand-y.svg)
![Expand prompt expanded](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/expand-d.svg)

---

#### Checkbox - `{type: 'checkbox'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `filter`, `validate`, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be an Array of the checked choices value.

Choices marked as `{checked: true}` will be checked by default.

Choices whose property `disabled` is truthy will be unselectable. If `disabled` is a string, then the string will be outputted next to the disabled choice, otherwise it'll default to `"Disabled"`. The `disabled` property can also be a synchronous function receiving the current answers as argument and returning a boolean or a string.

![Checkbox prompt](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/checkbox.svg)

---

#### Confirm - `{type: 'confirm'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, [`default`] properties. `default` is expected to be a boolean if used.

![Confirm prompt](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/confirm.svg)

---

#### Input - `{type: 'input'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`, `transformer`] properties.

![Input prompt](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/input.svg)

---

#### Input - `{type: 'number'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`, `transformer`] properties.

---

#### Password - `{type: 'password'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `mask`,[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.

![Password prompt](https://cdn.rawgit.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/28ae8337ba51d93e359ef4f7ee24e79b69898962/assets/screenshots/password.svg)

---

Note that `mask` is required to hide the actual user input.

#### Editor - `{type: 'editor'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties

Launches an instance of the users preferred editor on a temporary file. Once the user exits their editor, the contents of the temporary file are read in as the result. The editor to use is determined by reading the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables. If neither of those are present, notepad (on Windows) or vim (Linux or Mac) is used.

<a name="layouts"></a>

## User Interfaces and layouts

Along with the prompts, Inquirer offers some basic text UI.

#### Bottom Bar - `inquirer.ui.BottomBar`

This UI present a fixed text at the bottom of a free text zone. This is useful to keep a message to the bottom of the screen while outputting command outputs on the higher section.

```javascript
var ui = new inquirer.ui.BottomBar();

// pipe a Stream to the log zone
outputStream.pipe(ui.log);

// Or simply write output
ui.log.write('something just happened.');
ui.log.write('Almost over, standby!');

// During processing, update the bottom bar content to display a loader
// or output a progress bar, etc
ui.updateBottomBar('new bottom bar content');
```

<a name="reactive"></a>

## Reactive interface

Internally, Inquirer uses the [JS reactive extension](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) to handle events and async flows.

This mean you can take advantage of this feature to provide more advanced flows. For example, you can dynamically add questions to be asked:

```js
var prompts = new Rx.Subject();
inquirer.prompt(prompts);

// At some point in the future, push new questions
prompts.next({
  /* question... */
});
prompts.next({
  /* question... */
});

// When you're done
prompts.complete();
```

And using the return value `process` property, you can access more fine grained callbacks:

```js
inquirer.prompt(prompts).ui.process.subscribe(onEachAnswer, onError, onComplete);
```

## Support (OS Terminals)

<a name="support"></a>

You should expect mostly good support for the CLI below. This does not mean we won't
look at issues found on other command line - feel free to report any!

- **Mac OS**:
  - Terminal.app
  - iTerm

IP address utilities for node.js

## Installation

###  npm
```shell
npm install ip
```

### git

```shell
git clone https://github.com/indutny/node-ip.git
```
  
## Usage
Get your ip address, compare ip addresses, validate ip addresses, etc.

```js
var ip = require('ip');

ip.address() // my ip address
ip.isEqual('::1', '::0:1'); // true
ip.toBuffer('127.0.0.1') // Buffer([127, 0, 0, 1])
ip.toString(new Buffer([127, 0, 0, 1])) // 127.0.0.1
ip.fromPrefixLen(24) // 255.255.255.0
ip.mask('192.168.1.134', '255.255.255.0') // 192.168.1.0
ip.cidr('192.168.1.134/26') // 192.168.1.128
ip.not('255.255.255.0') // 0.0.0.255
ip.or('192.168.1.134', '0.0.0.255') // 192.168.1.255
ip.isPrivate('127.0.0.1') // true
ip.isV4Format('127.0.0.1'); // true
ip.isV6Format('::ffff:127.0.0.1'); // true

// operate on buffers in-place
var buf = new Buffer(128);
var offset = 64;
ip.toBuffer('127.0.0.1', buf, offset);  // [127, 0, 0, 1] at offset 64
ip.toString(buf, offset, 4);            // '127.0.0.1'

// subnet information
ip.subnet('192.168.1.134', '255.255.255.192')
// { networkAddress: '192.168.1.128',
//   firstAddress: '192.168.1.129',
//   lastAddress: '192.168.1.190',
//   broadcastAddress: '192.168.1.191',
//   subnetMask: '255.255.255.192',
//   subnetMaskLength: 26,
//   numHosts: 62,
//   length: 64,
//   contains: function(addr){...} }
ip.cidrSubnet('192.168.1.134/26')
// Same as previous.

// range checking
ip.cidrSubnet('192.168.1.134/26').contains('192.168.1.190') // true


// ipv4 long conversion
ip.toLong('127.0.0.1'); // 2130706433
ip.fromLong(2130706433); // '127.0.0.1'

# A JavaScript Testing Framework

Jasmine is a Behavior Driven Development testing framework for JavaScript. It does not rely on browsers, DOM, or any JavaScript framework. Thus it's suited for websites, [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) projects, or anywhere that JavaScript can run.

Documentation & guides live here: [http://jasmine.github.io](http://jasmine.github.io/)
For a quick start guide of Jasmine, see the beginning of [http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html](http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html)

Upgrading from Jasmine 2.x? Check out the [3.0 release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/v3.0.0/release_notes/3.0.md) for a list of what's new (including breaking changes).

## Contributing

Please read the [contributors' guide](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Installation

For the Jasmine NPM module:<br>
[https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm)

For the Jasmine Ruby Gem:<br>
[https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-gem](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-gem)

For the Jasmine Python Egg:<br>
[https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-py](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-py)

For the Jasmine headless browser gulp plugin:<br>
[https://github.com/jasmine/gulp-jasmine-browser](https://github.com/jasmine/gulp-jasmine-browser)

To install Jasmine standalone on your local box (where **_{#.#.#}_** below is substituted by the release number downloaded):

* Download the standalone distribution for your desired release from the [releases page](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases)
* Create a Jasmine directory in your project - `mkdir my-project/jasmine`
* Move the dist to your project directory - `mv jasmine/dist/jasmine-standalone-{#.#.#}.zip my-project/jasmine`
* Change directory - `cd my-project/jasmine`
* Unzip the dist - `unzip jasmine-standalone-{#.#.#}.zip`

Add the following to your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="jasmine/lib/jasmine-{#.#.#}/jasmine_favicon.png">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jasmine/lib/jasmine-{#.#.#}/jasmine.css">

<script type="text/javascript" src="jasmine/lib/jasmine-{#.#.#}/jasmine.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jasmine/lib/jasmine-{#.#.#}/jasmine-html.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jasmine/lib/jasmine-{#.#.#}/boot.js"></script>
```

## Supported environments

Jasmine tests itself across many browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and new Internet Explorer) as well as nodejs. To see the exact version tests are run against look at our [.travis.yml](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/master/.travis.yml)

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

# The Jasmine Module

The `jasmine` module is a package of helper code for developing Jasmine projects for Node.js. 

The core of jasmine lives at https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine and is `jasmine-core` in npm.

## Contents

This module allows you to run Jasmine specs for your Node.js code. The output will be displayed in your terminal by default.

## Documentation

https://jasmine.github.io/edge/node.html

## Installation
```sh
# Local installation:
npm install --save-dev jasmine

# Global installation
npm install -g jasmine
```

## Initializing

To initialize a project for Jasmine

`jasmine init`

To initialize a project for Jasmine when being installed locally

`node_modules/.bin/jasmine init`

or

`npx jasmine init`

To seed your project with some examples

`jasmine examples`

## Usage

To run your test suite

`jasmine`

## Configuration

Customize `spec/support/jasmine.json` to enumerate the source and spec files you would like the Jasmine runner to include.
You may use dir glob strings.
More information on the format of `jasmine.json` can be found in [the documentation](http://jasmine.github.io/edge/node.html#section-Configuration)

Alternatively, you may specify the path to your `jasmine.json` by setting an environment variable or an option:

```shell
jasmine JASMINE_CONFIG_PATH=relative/path/to/your/jasmine.json
jasmine --config=relative/path/to/your/jasmine.json
```

# Filtering specs

Execute only those specs which filename match given glob:

```shell
jasmine "spec/**/critical/*Spec.js"
```

Or a single file:

```shell
jasmine spec/currentSpec.js
```

Or execute only those specs which name matches a particular regex:

```shell
jasmine --filter "adapter21*"
```

(where the *name* of a spec is the first parameter passed to `describe()`)

GPL version 3
=============

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. Definitions.

   "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

   "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
   the copyright owner that is granting the License.

   "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
   control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
   "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

"Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.

"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Really Fast Deep Clone


[![build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/davidmarkclements/rfdc.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/davidmarkclements/rfdc)
[![coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/davidmarkclements/rfdc.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/davidmarkclements/rfdc)
[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://standardjs.com/)


## Usage

```js
const clone = require('rfdc')()
clone({a: 1, b: {c: 2}}) // => {a: 1, b: {c: 2}}
```

## API

### `require('rfdc')(opts = { proto: false, circles: false }) => clone(obj) => obj2`

#### `proto` option

Copy prototype properties as well as own properties into the new object.

It's marginally faster to allow enumerable properties on the prototype 
to be copied into the cloned object (not onto it's prototype, directly onto the object).

To explain by way of code:

```js
require('rfdc')({ proto: false })(Object.create({a: 1})) // => {}
require('rfdc')({ proto: true })(Object.create({a: 1})) // => {a: 1}
```

Setting `proto` to `true` will provide an additional 2% performance boost.

#### `circles` option

Keeping track of circular references will slow down performance with an
additional 25% overhead. Even if an object doesn't have any circular references,
the tracking overhead is the cost. By default if an object with a circular 
reference is passed to `rfdc`, it will throw (similar to how `JSON.stringify` \
would throw).

Use the `circles` option to detect and preserve circular references in the
object. If performance is important, try removing the circular reference from
the object (set to `undefined`) and then add it back manually after cloning
instead of using this option.

### Types

`rdfc` clones all JSON types:

* `Object`
* `Array`
* `Number`
* `String`
* `null`

With additional support for:

* `Date` (copied)
* `undefined` (copied)
* `Function` (referenced)
* `AsyncFunction` (referenced)
* `GeneratorFunction` (referenced)
* `arguments` (copied to a normal object)

All other types have output values that match the output
of `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(o))`.

For instance:

```js
const rdfc = require('rdfc')()
const err = Error()
err.code = 1
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(e)) // {code: 1}
rdfc(e) // {code: 1}

JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]))) //  {'0': 1, '1': 2, '2': 3 }
rdfc(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3])) //  {'0': 1, '1': 2, '2': 3 }

JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({rx: /foo/})) // {rx: {}}
rdfc({rx: /foo/}) // {rx: {}}
```

run-queue@1.0.3  ISC  https://github.com/iarna/run-queue/tree/latest/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# run-queue

A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.

```js
const RunQueue = require('run-queue')

const queue = new RunQueue({
  maxConcurrency: 1
})

queue.add(1, example, [-1])
for (let ii = 0; ii < 5; ++ii) {
  queue.add(0, example, [ii])
}
const finished = []
queue.run().then(
  console.log(finished)
})

function example (num, next) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    finished.push(num)
    next()
  }, 5 - Math.abs(num))
}
```

would output

```
[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ]
```

If you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:

```
[ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ]
```

The concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take
longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the
next priority level is run.  See
[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is
even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue
can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:

```
[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]
```

## API

### const queue = new RunQueue(options)

Create a new queue. Options may contain:

* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.
* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.

### queue.add (prio, fn, args)

Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`
with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.

### queue.run ()

Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either
all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a
rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected
with that error and no further queue running will be done.

## PRIORITIES

Priorities are any integer value >= 0.

Lowest is executed first.

Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue
must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.

This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`
must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs
while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`
queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs
complete.

        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Using Dart Sass

There are a few different ways to install and run Dart Sass, depending on your
environment and your needs.

### From Chocolatey or Scoop (Windows)

If you use [the Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/)
or [the Scoop package manager](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) for
Windows, you can install Dart Sass by running

```cmd
choco install sass
```

or

```cmd
scoop install sass
```

That'll give you a `sass` executable on your command line that will run Dart
Sass.

### From Homebrew (OS X)

If you use [the Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/) for Mac OS X, you
can install Dart Sass by running

```sh
brew install sass/sass/sass
```

That'll give you a `sass` executable on your command line that will run Dart
Sass.

### Standalone

You can download the standalone Dart Sass archive for your operating
system—containing the Dart VM and the snapshot of the executable—from [the
GitHub release page][]. Extract it, [add the directory to your path][], restart
your terminal, and the `sass` executable is ready to run!

[the GitHub release page]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/
[add the directory to your path]: https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/

### From npm

Dart Sass is available, compiled to JavaScript, [as an npm package][npm]. You
can install it globally using `npm install -g sass` which will provide access to
the `sass` executable. You can also add it to your project using
`npm install --save-dev sass`. This provides the executable as well as a
library:

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass

```js
var sass = require('sass');

sass.render({file: scss_filename}, function(err, result) { /* ... */ });

// OR

var result = sass.renderSync({file: scss_filename});
```

[See below](#javascript-api) for details on Dart Sass's JavaScript API.

### From Pub

If you're a Dart user, you can install Dart Sass globally using `pub global
activate sass`, which will provide a `sass` executable. You can also add it to
your pubspec and use it as a library. We strongly recommend importing it with
the prefix `sass`:

```dart
import 'package:sass/sass.dart' as sass;

void main(List<String> args) {
  print(sass.compile(args.first));
}
```

See [the Dart API docs][api] for details.

[api]: https://www.dartdocs.org/documentation/sass/latest/sass/sass-library.html

### From Source

Assuming you've already checked out this repository:

1. [Install Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/install). If you download an archive
   manually rather than using an installer, make sure the SDK's `bin` directory
   is on your `PATH`.

2. In this repository, run `pub get`. This will install Dart Sass's
   dependencies.

3. Run `dart bin/sass.dart path/to/file.scss`.

That's it!

## JavaScript API

When installed via npm, Dart Sass supports a JavaScript API that's fully
compatible with [Node Sass][] (with a few exceptions listed below), with support
for both the `render()` and `renderSync()` functions. See [the Sass
website][js api] for full API documentation!

[Node Sass]: https://github.com/sass/node-sass
[js api]: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api

Note however that by default, **`renderSync()` is more than twice as fast as
`render()`** due to the overhead of asynchronous callbacks. To avoid this
performance hit, `render()` can use the [`fibers`][fibers] package to call
asynchronous importers from the synchronous code path. To enable this, pass the
`Fiber` class to the `fiber` option:

[fibers]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/fibers

```js
var sass = require("sass");
var Fiber = require("fibers");

sass.render({
  file: "input.scss",
  importer: function(url, prev, done) {
    // ...
  },
  fiber: Fiber
}, function(err, result) {
  // ...
});
```

Both `render()` and `renderSync()` support the following options:

* [`data`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#data)
* [`file`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#file)
* [`functions`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#functions--v300---experimental)
* [`importer`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#importer--v200---experimental)
* [`includePaths`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths)
* [`indentType`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#indenttype)
* [`indentWidth`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#indentwidth)
* [`indentedSyntax`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#indentedsyntax)
* [`linefeed`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#linefeed)
* [`omitSourceMapUrl`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#omitsourcemapurl)
* [`outFile`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#outfile)
* [`sourceMapContents`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcemapcontents)
* [`sourceMapEmbed`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcemapembed)
* [`sourceMapRoot`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcemaproot)
* [`sourceMap`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcemap)
* Only the `"expanded"` and `"compressed"` values of
  [`outputStyle`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#outputstyle) are supported.

No support is intended for the following options:

* [`precision`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#precision). Dart Sass defaults
  to a sufficiently high precision for all existing browsers, and making this
  customizable would make the code substantially less efficient.

* [`sourceComments`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcecomments). Source
  maps are the recommended way of locating the origin of generated selectors.

## Why Dart?

Dart Sass has replaced Ruby Sass as the canonical implementation of the Sass
language. We chose Dart because it presented a number of advantages:

* It's fast. The Dart VM is highly optimized, and getting faster all the time
  (for the latest performance numbers, see [`perf.md`][perf]). It's much faster
  than Ruby, and close to par with C++.

* It's portable. The Dart VM has no external dependencies and can compile
  applications into standalone snapshot files, so we can distribute Dart Sass as
  only three files (the VM, the snapshot, and a wrapper script). Dart can also
  be compiled to JavaScript, which makes it easy to distribute Sass through npm,
  which the majority of our users use already.

* It's easy to write. Dart is a higher-level language than C++, which means it
  doesn't require lots of hassle with memory management and build systems. It's
  also statically typed, which makes it easier to confidently make large
  refactors than with Ruby.

* It's friendlier to contributors. Dart is substantially easier to learn than
  Ruby, and many Sass users in Google in particular are already familiar with
  it. More contributors translates to faster, more consistent development.

[perf]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/perf.md

## Compatibility Policy

For the most part, Dart Sass follows [semantic versioning][]. We consider all of
the following to be part of the versioned API:

[semantic versioning]: https://semver.org/

* The Sass language semantics implemented by Dart Sass.
* The Dart API.
* The JavaScript API.
* The command-line interface.

Because Dart Sass has a single version that's shared across the Dart,
JavaScript, and standalone distributions, this may mean that we increment the
major version number when there are in fact no breaking changes for one or more
distributions. However, we will attempt to limit the number of breaking changes
we make and group them in as few releases as possible to minimize churn. We
strongly encourage users to use [the changelog][] for a full understanding of
all the changes in each release.

[the changelog]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

There is one exception where breaking changes may be made outside of a major
version revision. It is occasionally the case that CSS adds a feature that's
incompatible with existing Sass syntax in some way. Because Sass is committed to
full CSS compatibility, we occasionally need to break compatibility with old
Sass code in order to remain compatible with CSS.

In these cases, we will first release a version of Sass that emits deprecation
warnings for any stylesheets whose behavior will change. Then, at least three
months after the release of a version with these deprecation warnings, we will
release a minor version with the breaking change to the Sass language semantics.

### Browser Compatibility

In general, we consider any change to Dart Sass's CSS output that would cause
that CSS to stop working in a real browser to be a breaking change. However,
there are some cases where such a change would have substantial benefits and
would only negatively affect a small minority of rarely-used browsers. We don't
want to have to block such a change on a major version release.

As such, if a change would break compatibility with less than 2% of the global
market share of browser according to [StatCounter GlobalStats][], we may release
a minor version of Dart Sass with that change.

[StatCounter GlobalStats]: http://gs.statcounter.com/

### Node.js Compatibility

We consider dropping support for a given version of Node.js to be a breaking
change *as long as* that version is still supported by Node.js. This means that
releases listed as Current, Active LTS, or Maintenance LTS according to [the
Node.js release page][]. Once a Node.js version is out of LTS, Dart Sass
considers itself free to break support if necessary.

[the Node.js release page]: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

## Behavioral Differences from Ruby Sass

There are a few intentional behavioral differences between Dart Sass and Ruby
Sass. These are generally places where Ruby Sass has an undesired behavior, and
it's substantially easier to implement the correct behavior than it would be to
implement compatible behavior. These should all have tracking bugs against Ruby
Sass to update the reference behavior.

1. `@extend` only accepts simple selectors, as does the second argument of
   `selector-extend()`. See [issue 1599][].

2. Subject selectors are not supported. See [issue 1126][].

3. Pseudo selector arguments are parsed as `<declaration-value>`s rather than
   having a more limited custom parsing. See [issue 2120][].

4. The numeric precision is set to 10. See [issue 1122][].

5. The indented syntax parser is more flexible: it doesn't require consistent
   indentation across the whole document. See [issue 2176][].

6. Colors do not support channel-by-channel arithmetic. See [issue 2144][].

7. Unitless numbers aren't `==` to unit numbers with the same value. In
   addition, map keys follow the same logic as `==`-equality. See
   [issue 1496][].

8. `rgba()` and `hsla()` alpha values with percentage units are interpreted as
   percentages. Other units are forbidden. See [issue 1525][].

9. Too many variable arguments passed to a function is an error. See
   [issue 1408][].

10. Allow `@extend` to reach outside a media query if there's an identical
    `@extend` defined outside that query. This isn't tracked explicitly, because
    it'll be irrelevant when [issue 1050][] is fixed.

11. Some selector pseudos containing placeholder selectors will be compiled
    where they wouldn't be in Ruby Sass. This better matches the semantics of
    the selectors in question, and is more efficient. See [issue 2228][].

12. The old-style `:property value` syntax is not supported in the indented
    syntax. See [issue 2245][].

13. The reference combinator is not supported. See [issue 303][].

14. Universal selector unification is symmetrical. See [issue 2247][].

15. `@extend` doesn't produce an error if it matches but fails to unify. See
    [issue 2250][].

16. Dart Sass currently only supports UTF-8 documents. We'd like to support
    more, but Dart currently doesn't support them. See [dart-lang/sdk#11744][],
    for example.

# Node Sauce Labs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/saucelabs/node-saucelabs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saucelabs/node-saucelabs)

Wrapper around the Sauce Labs REST APIs for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (v8 or higher).

## Install

To install the package run:

```shell
npm install saucelabs
```

## Options

### user

Your Sauce Labs username.

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `process.env.SAUCE_USERNAME`

### key

Your Sauce Labs access key.

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `process.env.SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`

### region

Your Sauce Labs datacenter region. The following regions are available:

- `us-west-1` (short `us`)
- `eu-central-1` (short `eu`)

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `us`

### headless

If set to true you are accessing the headless Sauce instances (this discards the `region` option).

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

## Usage

All accessible API commands with descriptions can be found [here](docs/interface.md). In order to route requests through a proxy set `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` or `NO_PROXY` as environment variable. For more information on this, read [here](https://github.com/request/request#controlling-proxy-behaviour-using-environment-variables). Alternatively you can pass the proxy to be used during initialization:

```js
import SauceLabs from 'saucelabs';

...

const myAccount = new SauceLabs({ proxy: 'http://localproxy.com' });
```

### As CLI Tool

This package if installed globally can be used as CLI tool to access the API from the command line:

```sh
$ npm install -g saucelabs
...
$ sl listJobs $SAUCE_USERNAME --limit 5 --region eu
{ jobs:
   [ { id: '19dab74f8fd848518f8d2c2cee3a6fbd' },
     { id: 'dc08ca0c7fa14eee909a093d11567328' },
     { id: '5bc6f70c777b4ae3bf7909a40f5ee41b' },
     { id: 'f40fe7b044754eaaa5f5a130406549b5' },
     { id: 'd1553f71f910402893f1e82a4dcb6ca6' } ] }
```

You can find all available commands and options with description by calling:

```sh
sl --help
# show description for specific command
sl listJobs --help
```

or update the job status by calling:

```sh
sl updateJob cb-onboarding 690c5877710c422d8be4c622b40c747f "{\"passed\":false}"
```

### As NPM Package

The following example shows how to access details of the last job you were running with your account that is being exposed as environment variables as `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`. Alternatively you can pass the credentials via `options` to the constructor:

```js
import SauceLabs from 'saucelabs';
// if imports are not supported by your Node.js version, import the package as follows:
// const SauceLabs = require('saucelabs').default;

(async () => {
    const myAccount = new SauceLabs();
    // using constructor options
    // const myAccount = new SauceLabs({ user: "YOUR-USER", key: "YOUR-ACCESS-KEY"});

    // get job details of last run job
    const job = await myAccount.listJobs(
        process.env.SAUCE_USERNAME,
        { limit: 1, full: true }
    );

    console.log(job);
    /**
     * outputs:
     * { jobs:
        [ { browser_short_version: '72',
            video_url:
             'https://assets.saucelabs.com/jobs/dc08ca0c7fa14eee909a093d11567328/video.flv',
            creation_time: 1551711453,
            'custom-data': null,
            browser_version: '72.0.3626.81',
            owner: '<username-redacted>',
            id: 'dc08ca0c7fa14eee909a093d11567328',
            record_screenshots: true,
            record_video: true,
            build: null,
            passed: null,
            public: 'team',
            end_time: 1551711471,
            status: 'complete',
            log_url:
             'https://assets.saucelabs.com/jobs/dc08ca0c7fa14eee909a093d11567328/selenium-server.log',
            start_time: 1551711454,
            proxied: false,
            modification_time: 1551711471,
            tags: [],
            name: null,
            commands_not_successful: 1,
            consolidated_status: 'complete',
            manual: false,
            assigned_tunnel_id: null,
            error: null,
            os: 'Windows 2008',
            breakpointed: null,
            browser: 'googlechrome' } ] }
     */
})()
```

> You may wonder why `listJobs` requires a `username` as first parameter since you've already defined the process.env. The reason for this is that Sauce Labs supports a concept of Team Accounts, so-called sub-accounts, grouped together. As such functions like the mentioned could list jobs not only for the requesting account, but also for the individual team account. Learn more about it [here](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Managing+Team+Members+and+Accounts)

## Breaking changes from v1 to v2

Public APIs have changed from v1 to v2. Methods in v1 accepted a `callback` trailing parameter which is no more available with v2, instead all methods now return a Promise which can be `awaited` or `then`'d.

Below, you can find the list of the mapped method names:

| v1 | v2 |
|----|----|
| getAccountDetails(callback)   | async getUser(username) |
| getAccountLimits(callback)   | ? |
| getUserActivity(callback)   | async getUserActivity(username) |
| getUserConcurrency(callback) | async getUserConcurrency(username) |
| getAccountUsage(start, end, callback) | ? |
| getJobs(callback) | async listJobs(username, { ...options }) // with option: full: true |
| showJob(id, callback) | async getJob(username, id) |
| showJobAssets(id, callback) | ? |
| updateJob(id, data, callback) | async updateJob(username, id, body) |
| stopJob(id, data, callback) | async stopJob(username, id) |
| deleteJob(id, callback) | ? |
| getActiveTunnels(callback) | async listAvailableTunnels(username) |
| getTunnel(id, callback) | async getTunnel(username, id) |
| deleteTunnel(id, callback) | async deleteTunnel(username, id) |
| getServiceStatus(callback) |async getStatus() |
| getBrowsers(callback) | ? |
| getAllBrowsers(callback) | async listPlatforms(platform)  // pass "all" |
| getSeleniumBrowsers(callback) | Selenium-RC no longer supported |
| getWebDriverBrowsers(callback) | async listPlatforms(platform) // pass "webdriver" |
| getTestCounter(callback) | ? |
| updateSubAccount(data, callback) | ? |
| deleteSubAccount(callback) | ? |
| createSubAccount(data, callback) | ? |
| createPublicLink(id, date, useHour, callback) | ? |
| getSubAccountList(callback) | ? |
| getSubAccounts(callback) | ? |

## Test

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mgechev/semver-dsl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mgechev/semver-dsl)

# SemVer DSL

A simple internal DSL which allows you to invoke different functionality depending on version match. Used in codelyzer for keeping the code compatible across different versions of the Angular compiler.

# Demo

```bash
$ npm i semver-dsl --save
```

```ts
import {SemVerDSL} from 'semver-dsl';

const base = () => {};
const elseIf1 = () => {};
const elseIf2 = () => {};
const else = () => console.log('I will be invoked!');

SemVerDSL('3.0.0')
  .gt('3.2.1', base)
  .elseIf.gt('3.0.1', elseIf1)
  .elseIf.between('3.0.1', '3.1.8', elseIf2)
  .else(else);
```

In the example above will be invoked `else`.

# API

- `SemDSL(version: string)` - factory which accepts a version and returns an object.
- `gte(version: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` and `else` properties.
- `lte(version: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` and `else` properties.
- `gt(version: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` and `else` properties.
- `lt(version: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` and `else` properties.
- `eq(version: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` and `else` properties.
- `neq(version: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` and `else` properties.
- `between(v1: string, v2: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` properties.
- `elseIf` - returns an object of type `ISemVerDSL` bound to the previous predicate.
- `else` - invokes given callback if all of the previous conditions have failed.

```ts
export interface ISemVerDSL {
  gte(version: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;
  lte(version: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;
  gt(version: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;
  lt(version: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;
  eq(version: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;
  neq(version: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;
  between(v1: string, v2: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;
}
```

```ts
export interface ISemVerContextBoundDSL {
  elseIf: ISemVerDSL;
  else(callback: Function): void;
}
```

# slash [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/slash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/slash)

> Convert Windows backslash paths to slash paths: `foo\\bar` ➔ `foo/bar`

[Forward-slash paths can be used in Windows](http://superuser.com/a/176395/6877) as long as they're not extended-length paths and don't contain any non-ascii characters.

This was created since the `path` methods in Node.js outputs `\\` paths on Windows.


## Install

```
$ npm install slash
```


## Usage

```js
const path = require('path');
const slash = require('slash');

const string = path.join('foo', 'bar');
// Unix    => foo/bar
// Windows => foo\\bar

slash(string);
// Unix    => foo/bar
// Windows => foo/bar
```


## API

### slash(path)

Type: `string`

Accepts a Windows backslash path and returns a path with forward slashes.

socks-proxy-agent@4.0.2  MIT  https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
socks-proxy-agent
================
### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a
specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http`
and `https` modules.

It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket
connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install socks-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### TypeScript example

```ts
import https from 'https';
import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';

const info = {
	host: 'br41.nordvpn.com',
	userId: 'your-name@gmail.com',
	password: 'abcdef12345124'
};
const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(info);

https.get('https://jsonip.org', { agent }, (res) => {
	console.log(res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `http` module example

```js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
	console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `https` module example

```js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

https.get(opts, function (res) {
	console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);

// initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
	console.log('"open" event!');
	socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
	console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
	socket.close();
});
```

source-list-map@0.1.8  MIT  https://github.com/webpack/source-list-map/tree/master/README.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# source-list-map

## API

### Example

``` js
var SourceListMap = require("source-list-map").SourceListMap;

// Create a new map
var map = new SourceListMap();

// Add generated code that is map line to line to some soure
map.add("Generated\ncode1\n", "source-code.js", "Orginal\nsource");

// Add generated code that isn't mapped
map.add("Generated\ncode2\n");

// Get SourceMap and generated source
map.toStringWithSourceMap({ file: "generated-code.js" });
// {
//   source: 'Generated\ncode1\nGenerated\ncode2\n',
//   map: {
//      version: 3,
//      file: 'generated-code.js',
//      sources: [ 'source-code.js' ],
//      sourcesContent: [ 'Orginal\nsource' ],
//      mappings: 'AAAA;AACA;;;'
//    }
// }

// Convert existing SourceMap into SourceListMap
// (Only the first mapping per line is preserved)
var fromStringWithSourceMap = require("source-list-map").fromStringWithSourceMap;
var map = fromStringWithSourceMap("Generated\ncode", { version: 3, ... });

```

### `new SourceListMap()`

### `SourceListMap.prototype.add`

``` js
SourceListMap.prototype.add(generatedCode: string)
SourceListMap.prototype.add(generatedCode: string, source: string, originalSource: string)
SourceListMap.prototype.add(sourceListMap: SourceListMap)
```

Append some stuff.

### `SourceListMap.prototype.prepend`

``` js
SourceListMap.prototype.prepend(generatedCode: string)
SourceListMap.prototype.prepend(generatedCode: string, source: string, originalSource: string)
SourceListMap.prototype.prepend(sourceListMap: SourceListMap)
```

Prepend some stuff.

### `SourceListMap.prototype.toString()`

Get generated code.

### `SourceListMap.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap`

``` js
SourceListMap.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap(options: object)
```

Get generated code and SourceMap. `options` can contains `file` property which defines the `file` property of the SourceMap.

### `SourceListMap.prototype.mapGeneratedCode`

``` js
SourceListMap.prototype.mapGeneratedCode(fn: function) : SourceListMap
```

Applies `fn` to each generated code block (per line). The returned value is set as new generated code. Returns a new SourceListMap.

Removing and adding lines is supported. The SourceMap complexity will increase when doing this.

## Examples

### Consuming a source map

```js
const rawSourceMap = {
  version: 3,
  file: "min.js",
  names: ["bar", "baz", "n"],
  sources: ["one.js", "two.js"],
  sourceRoot: "http://example.com/www/js/",
  mappings: "CAAC,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUA,GAClB,OAAOC,IAAID;CCDb,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUE,GAClB,OAAOA"
};

const whatever = await SourceMapConsumer.with(rawSourceMap, null, consumer => {
  console.log(consumer.sources);
  // [ 'http://example.com/www/js/one.js',
  //   'http://example.com/www/js/two.js' ]

  console.log(
    consumer.originalPositionFor({
      line: 2,
      column: 28
    })
  );
  // { source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js',
  //   line: 2,
  //   column: 10,
  //   name: 'n' }

  console.log(
    consumer.generatedPositionFor({
      source: "http://example.com/www/js/two.js",
      line: 2,
      column: 10
    })
  );
  // { line: 2, column: 28 }

  consumer.eachMapping(function(m) {
    // ...
  });

  return computeWhatever();
});
```

### Generating a source map

In depth guide:
[**Compiling to JavaScript, and Debugging with Source Maps**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/compiling-to-javascript-and-debugging-with-source-maps/)

#### With SourceNode (high level API)

```js
function compile(ast) {
  switch (ast.type) {
    case "BinaryExpression":
      return new SourceNode(ast.location.line, ast.location.column, ast.location.source, [
        compile(ast.left),
        " + ",
        compile(ast.right)
      ]);
    case "Literal":
      return new SourceNode(ast.location.line, ast.location.column, ast.location.source, String(ast.value));
    // ...
    default:
      throw new Error("Bad AST");
  }
}

var ast = parse("40 + 2", "add.js");
console.log(
  compile(ast).toStringWithSourceMap({
    file: "add.js"
  })
);
// { code: '40 + 2',
//   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] }
```

#### With SourceMapGenerator (low level API)

```js
var map = new SourceMapGenerator({
  file: "source-mapped.js"
});

map.addMapping({
  generated: {
    line: 10,
    column: 35
  },
  source: "foo.js",
  original: {
    line: 33,
    column: 2
  },
  name: "christopher"
});

console.log(map.toString());
// '{"version":3,"file":"source-mapped.js","sources":["foo.js"],"names":["christopher"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;mCAgCEA"}'
```

## API

Get a reference to the module:

```js
// Node.js
var sourceMap = require("source-map");

// Browser builds
var sourceMap = window.sourceMap;

// Inside Firefox
const sourceMap = require("devtools/toolkit/sourcemap/source-map.js");
```

### SourceMapConsumer

A `SourceMapConsumer` instance represents a parsed source map which we can query
for information about the original file positions by giving it a file position
in the generated source.

#### SourceMapConsumer.initialize(options)

When using `SourceMapConsumer` outside of node.js, for example on the Web, it
needs to know from what URL to load `lib/mappings.wasm`. You must inform it by
calling `initialize` before constructing any `SourceMapConsumer`s.

The options object has the following properties:

- `"lib/mappings.wasm"`: A `String` containing the URL of the
  `lib/mappings.wasm` file, or an `ArrayBuffer` with the contents of `lib/mappings.wasm`.

```js
sourceMap.SourceMapConsumer.initialize({
  "lib/mappings.wasm": "https://example.com/source-map/lib/mappings.wasm"
});
```

#### new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap)

The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a string which can be
`JSON.parse`'d, or an object). According to the spec, source maps have the
following attributes:

- `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.

- `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.

- `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referenced by individual
  mappings.

- `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.

- `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.

- `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.

- `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.

The promise of the constructed souce map consumer is returned.

When the `SourceMapConsumer` will no longer be used anymore, you must call its
`destroy` method.

```js
const consumer = await new sourceMap.SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMapJsonData);
doStuffWith(consumer);
consumer.destroy();
```

Alternatively, you can use `SourceMapConsumer.with` to avoid needing to remember
to call `destroy`.

#### SourceMapConsumer.with

Construct a new `SourceMapConsumer` from `rawSourceMap` and `sourceMapUrl`
(see the `SourceMapConsumer` constructor for details. Then, invoke the `async function f(SourceMapConsumer) -> T` with the newly constructed consumer, wait
for `f` to complete, call `destroy` on the consumer, and return `f`'s return
value.

You must not use the consumer after `f` completes!

By using `with`, you do not have to remember to manually call `destroy` on
the consumer, since it will be called automatically once `f` completes.

```js
const xSquared = await SourceMapConsumer.with(myRawSourceMap, null, async function(consumer) {
  // Use `consumer` inside here and don't worry about remembering
  // to call `destroy`.

  const x = await whatever(consumer);
  return x * x;
});

// You may not use that `consumer` anymore out here; it has
// been destroyed. But you can use `xSquared`.
console.log(xSquared);
```

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.destroy()

Free this source map consumer's associated wasm data that is manually-managed.

```js
consumer.destroy();
```

Alternatively, you can use `SourceMapConsumer.with` to avoid needing to remember
to call `destroy`.

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()

Compute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is
inclusive.

```js
// Before:
consumer.allGeneratedPositionsFor({ line: 2, source: "foo.coffee" });
// [ { line: 2,
//     column: 1 },
//   { line: 2,
//     column: 10 },
//   { line: 2,
//     column: 20 } ]

consumer.computeColumnSpans();

// After:
consumer.allGeneratedPositionsFor({ line: 2, source: "foo.coffee" });
// [ { line: 2,
//     column: 1,
//     lastColumn: 9 },
//   { line: 2,
//     column: 10,
//     lastColumn: 19 },
//   { line: 2,
//     column: 20,
//     lastColumn: Infinity } ]
```

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)

Returns the original source, line, and column information for the generated
source's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with
the following properties:

- `line`: The line number in the generated source. Line numbers in
  this library are 1-based (note that the underlying source map
  specification uses 0-based line numbers -- this library handles the
  translation).

- `column`: The column number in the generated source. Column numbers
  in this library are 0-based.

- `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or
  `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest
  element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,
  respectively, if the exact element cannot be found. Defaults to
  `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.

and an object is returned with the following properties:

- `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not
  available.

- `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is
  not available. The line number is 1-based.

- `column`: The column number in the original source, or null if this
  information is not available. The column number is 0-based.

- `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.

```js
consumer.originalPositionFor({ line: 2, column: 10 });
// { source: 'foo.coffee',
//   line: 2,
//   column: 2,
//   name: null }

consumer.originalPositionFor({
  line: 99999999999999999,
  column: 999999999999999
});
// { source: null,
//   line: null,
//   column: null,
//   name: null }
```

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)

Returns the generated line and column information for the original source,
line, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with
the following properties:

- `source`: The filename of the original source.

- `line`: The line number in the original source. The line number is
  1-based.

- `column`: The column number in the original source. The column
  number is 0-based.

and an object is returned with the following properties:

- `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null. The line
  number is 1-based.

- `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null. The
  column number is 0-based.

```js
consumer.generatedPositionFor({ source: "example.js", line: 2, column: 10 });
// { line: 1,
//   column: 56 }
```

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)

Returns all generated line and column information for the original source, line,
and column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings
corresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line
that has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the
given line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column
that has any offsets.

The only argument is an object with the following properties:

- `source`: The filename of the original source.

- `line`: The line number in the original source. The line number is
  1-based.

- `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source. The
  column number is 0-based.

and an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:

- `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null. The line
  number is 1-based.

- `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null. The
  column number is 0-based.

```js
consumer.allGeneratedPositionsFor({ line: 2, source: "foo.coffee" });
// [ { line: 2,
//     column: 1 },
//   { line: 2,
//     column: 10 },
//   { line: 2,
//     column: 20 } ]
```

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()

Return true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in
the source map, false otherwise.

In other words, if this method returns `true`, then
`consumer.sourceContentFor(s)` will succeed for every source `s` in
`consumer.sources`.

```js
// ...
if (consumer.hasContentsOfAllSources()) {
  consumerReadyCallback(consumer);
} else {
  fetchSources(consumer, consumerReadyCallback);
}
// ...
```

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])

Returns the original source content for the source provided. The only
argument is the URL of the original source file.

If the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is
thrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned
instead.

```js
consumer.sources;
// [ "my-cool-lib.clj" ]

consumer.sourceContentFor("my-cool-lib.clj");
// "..."

consumer.sourceContentFor("this is not in the source map");
// Error: "this is not in the source map" is not in the source map

consumer.sourceContentFor("this is not in the source map", true);
// null
```

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)

Iterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a
generated line/column in this source map.

- `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the
  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn, name }`

- `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`
  every time that `callback` is called.

- `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or
  `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over
  the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the
  original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to
  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.

```js
consumer.eachMapping(function(m) {
  console.log(m);
});
// ...
// { source: 'illmatic.js',
//   generatedLine: 1,
//   generatedColumn: 0,
//   originalLine: 1,
//   originalColumn: 0,
//   name: null }
// { source: 'illmatic.js',
//   generatedLine: 2,
//   generatedColumn: 0,
//   originalLine: 2,
//   originalColumn: 0,
//   name: null }
// ...
```

### SourceMapGenerator

An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being
built incrementally.

#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])

You may pass an object with the following properties:

- `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is
  associated with.

- `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.

- `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as
  they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with
  discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when
  running tests, if possible.

```js
var generator = new sourceMap.SourceMapGenerator({
  file: "my-generated-javascript-file.js",
  sourceRoot: "http://example.com/app/js/"
});
```

#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)

Creates a new `SourceMapGenerator` from an existing `SourceMapConsumer` instance.

- `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.

```js
var generator = sourceMap.SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(consumer);
```

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)

Add a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated
source's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object
should have the following properties:

- `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.

- `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.

- `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).

- `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.

```js
generator.addMapping({
  source: "module-one.scm",
  original: { line: 128, column: 0 },
  generated: { line: 3, column: 456 }
});
```

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)

Set the source content for an original source file.

- `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.

- `sourceContent` the content of the source file.

```js
generator.setSourceContent("module-one.scm", fs.readFileSync("path/to/module-one.scm"));
```

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])

Applies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.
Each mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the
supplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings
is the minimum of this map and the supplied map.

- `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.

- `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.
  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.
  Otherwise an error will be thrown.

- `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap
  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.

  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same
  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source
  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten
  relative to the SourceMap.

  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,
  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()

Renders the source map being generated to a string.

```js
generator.toString();
// '{"version":3,"sources":["module-one.scm"],"names":[],"mappings":"...snip...","file":"my-generated-javascript-file.js","sourceRoot":"http://example.com/app/js/"}'
```

### SourceNode

SourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating
snippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and
column information associated between those snippets and the original source
code. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might
use before outputting the generated JS and source map.

#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])

- `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if
  it isn't associated with an original line. The line number is 1-based.

- `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null
  if it isn't associated with an original column. The column number
  is 0-based.

- `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.

- `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see
  below.

- `name`: Optional. The original identifier.

```js
var node = new SourceNode(1, 2, "a.cpp", [
  new SourceNode(3, 4, "b.cpp", "extern int status;\n"),
  new SourceNode(5, 6, "c.cpp", "std::string* make_string(size_t n);\n"),
  new SourceNode(7, 8, "d.cpp", "int main(int argc, char** argv) {}\n")
]);
```

#### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])

Creates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.

- `code`: The generated code

- `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code

- `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`
  should be relative to.

```js
const consumer = await new SourceMapConsumer(fs.readFileSync("path/to/my-file.js.map", "utf8"));
const node = SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(fs.readFileSync("path/to/my-file.js"), consumer);
```

#### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)

Add a chunk of generated JS to this source node.

- `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of
  `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.

```js
node.add(" + ");
node.add(otherNode);
node.add([leftHandOperandNode, " + ", rightHandOperandNode]);
```

#### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)

Prepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.

- `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of
  `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.

```js
node.prepend("/** Build Id: f783haef86324gf **/\n\n");
```

#### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)

Set the source content for a source file. This will be added to the
`SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.

- `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file

- `sourceContent`: The content of the source file

```js
node.setSourceContent("module-one.scm", fs.readFileSync("path/to/module-one.scm"));
```

#### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)

Walk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking
function is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and
the its original associated source's line/column location.

- `fn`: The traversal function.

```js
var node = new SourceNode(1, 2, "a.js", [
  new SourceNode(3, 4, "b.js", "uno"),
  "dos",
  ["tres", new SourceNode(5, 6, "c.js", "quatro")]
]);

node.walk(function(code, loc) {
  console.log("WALK:", code, loc);
});
// WALK: uno { source: 'b.js', line: 3, column: 4, name: null }
// WALK: dos { source: 'a.js', line: 1, column: 2, name: null }
// WALK: tres { source: 'a.js', line: 1, column: 2, name: null }
// WALK: quatro { source: 'c.js', line: 5, column: 6, name: null }
```

#### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)

Walk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each
source file content and is passed the filename and source content.

- `fn`: The traversal function.

```js
var a = new SourceNode(1, 2, "a.js", "generated from a");
a.setSourceContent("a.js", "original a");
var b = new SourceNode(1, 2, "b.js", "generated from b");
b.setSourceContent("b.js", "original b");
var c = new SourceNode(1, 2, "c.js", "generated from c");
c.setSourceContent("c.js", "original c");

var node = new SourceNode(null, null, null, [a, b, c]);
node.walkSourceContents(function(source, contents) {
  console.log("WALK:", source, ":", contents);
});
// WALK: a.js : original a
// WALK: b.js : original b
// WALK: c.js : original c
```

#### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)

Like `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator
between each of this source node's children.

- `sep`: The separator.

```js
var lhs = new SourceNode(1, 2, "a.rs", "my_copy");
var operand = new SourceNode(3, 4, "a.rs", "=");
var rhs = new SourceNode(5, 6, "a.rs", "orig.clone()");

var node = new SourceNode(null, null, null, [lhs, operand, rhs]);
var joinedNode = node.join(" ");
```

#### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)

Call `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful
for trimming white space from the end of a source node, etc.

- `pattern`: The pattern to replace.

- `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.

```js
// Trim trailing white space.
node.replaceRight(/\s*$/, "");
```

#### SourceNode.prototype.toString()

Return the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and
concatenates all the various snippets together to one string.

```js
var node = new SourceNode(1, 2, "a.js", [
  new SourceNode(3, 4, "b.js", "uno"),
  "dos",
  ["tres", new SourceNode(5, 6, "c.js", "quatro")]
]);

node.toString();
// 'unodostresquatro'
```

#### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])

Returns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a
SourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and
original sources.

The arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.

```js
var node = new SourceNode(1, 2, "a.js", [
  new SourceNode(3, 4, "b.js", "uno"),
  "dos",
  ["tres", new SourceNode(5, 6, "c.js", "quatro")]
]);

node.toStringWithSourceMap({ file: "my-output-file.js" });
// { code: 'unodostresquatro',
//   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] }
```

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# SPDY Server for node.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/spdy.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/spdy)
[![dependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy/status.svg?style=flat-square)](https://david-dm.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy)
[![Standard - JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://standardjs.com/)
[![Waffle](https://img.shields.io/badge/track-waffle-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://waffle.io/spdy-http2/node-spdy)

With this module you can create [HTTP2][0] / [SPDY][1] servers
in node.js with natural http module interface and fallback to regular https
(for browsers that don't support neither HTTP2, nor SPDY yet).

This module named `spdy` but it [provides](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy/issues/269#issuecomment-239014184) support for both http/2 (h2) and spdy (2,3,3.1). Also, `spdy` is compatible with Express.

## Usage

### Examples

Server:
```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy'),
    fs = require('fs');

var options = {
  // Private key
  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),

  // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)
  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem'),

  // **optional** SPDY-specific options
  spdy: {
    protocols: [ 'h2', 'spdy/3.1', ..., 'http/1.1' ],
    plain: false,

    // **optional**
    // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the
    // headers of every request.
    // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that
    // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR
    'x-forwarded-for': true,

    connection: {
      windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size

      // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy
      autoSpdy31: false
    }
  }
};

var server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('hello world!');
});

server.listen(3000);
```

Client:
```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy');
var https = require('https');

var agent = spdy.createAgent({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443,

  // Optional SPDY options
  spdy: {
    plain: false,
    ssl: true,

    // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR
    'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'
  }
});

https.get({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  agent: agent
}, function(response) {
  console.log('yikes');
  // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request
  // ...
  // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server
  // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!
  agent.close();
}).end();
```

Please note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level
errors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe
to the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:

```javascript
var agent = spdy.createAgent({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  port: 443
}).once('error', function (err) {
  this.emit(err);
});
```

#### Push streams

It is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_
the client requests it.

```javascript
spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  var stream = res.push('/main.js', {
    status: 200, // optional
    method: 'GET', // optional
    request: {
      accept: '*/*'
    },
    response: {
      'content-type': 'application/javascript'
    }
  });
  stream.on('error', function() {
  });
  stream.end('alert("hello from push stream!");');

  res.end('<script src="/main.js"></script>');
}).listen(3000);
```

[PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response
object.  The signature of the `push()` method is:

`.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`

Second argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response.
`callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a
[Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.

Client usage:
```javascript
var agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ });
var req = http.get({
  host: 'www.google.com',
  agent: agent
}, function(response) {
});
req.on('push', function(stream) {
  stream.on('error', function(err) {
    // Handle error
  });
  // Read data from stream
});
```

NOTE: You're responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()`
callback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in
uncaught exception and crash your program.

#### Trailing headers

Server usage:
```javascript
function (req, res) {
  // Send trailing headers to client
  res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });

  // On client's trailing headers
  req.on('trailers', function(headers) {
    // ...
  });
}
```

Client usage:
```javascript
var req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {
  // On server's trailing headers
  res.on('trailers', function(headers) {
    // ...
  });
});
req.write('stuff');
req.addTrailers({ /* ... */ });
req.end();
```

#### Options

All options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.

Additional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:

* `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether
  to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet.
* `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used
  as a `base` class for created server.
* `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA
  chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about
  interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.
  (defaults to 8192)
* `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:
  `['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`)
* `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition,
* `maxStreams` - set "[maximum concurrent streams][3]" protocol option

### API

API is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another
function as base class for SPDYServer.

```javascript
spdy.createServer(
  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],
  { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument
  [request listener]
).listen([port], [host], [callback]);
```

Request listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're
both instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three
custom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy`
is `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is
`false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`,
`3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# URI.js

URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc).
It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.

URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).

	URI.parse("uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  scheme : "uri",
	//  userinfo : "user:pass",
	//  host : "example.com",
	//  port : 123,
	//  path : "/one/two.three",
	//  query : "q1=a1&q2=a2",
	//  fragment : "body"
	//}

### Serializing

	URI.serialize({scheme : "http", host : "example.com", fragment : "footer"}) === "http://example.com/#footer"

### Resolving

	URI.resolve("uri://a/b/c/d?q", "../../g") === "uri://a/g"

### Normalizing

	URI.normalize("HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html") === "http://abc.com/~smith/home.html"

### Comparison

	URI.equal("example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D", "eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d") === true

### IP Support

	//IPv4 normalization
	URI.normalize("//192.068.001.000") === "//192.68.1.0"

	//IPv6 normalization
	URI.normalize("//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]") === "//[2001:0:db8::1]"

	//IPv6 zone identifier support
	URI.parse("//[2001:db8::7%25en1]");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  host : "2001:db8::7%en1"
	//}

### IRI Support

	//convert IRI to URI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://examplé.org/rosé")) === "http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"
	//convert URI to IRI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"), {iri:true}) === "http://examplé.org/rosé"

### Options

All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:

*	`scheme` (string)

	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.

*	`reference` (string)

	If set to `"suffix"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.

*	`tolerant` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.

*	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.

*	`iri` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

*	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

*	`domainHost` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).

## Scheme Extendable

URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:

*	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\]
*	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\]
*	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\]
*	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\]
*	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]

### HTTP Support

	URI.equal("HTTP://ABC.COM:80", "http://abc.com/") === true

### Mailto Support

	URI.parse("mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "mailto",
	//	to : ["alpha@example.com", "bravo@example.com"],
	//	subject : "SUBSCRIBE",
	//	body : "Sign me up!"
	//}

	URI.serialize({
		scheme : "mailto",
		to : ["alpha@example.com"],
		subject : "REMOVE",
		body : "Please remove me",
		headers : {
			cc : "charlie@example.com"
		}
	}) === "mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me"

### URN Support

	URI.parse("urn:example:foo");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "urn",
	//	nid : "example",
	//	nss : "foo",
	//}

#### URN UUID Support

	URI.parse("urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "urn",
	//	nid : "example",
	//	uuid : "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6",
	//}

## Usage

To load in a browser, use the following tag:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js"></script>

To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:

	npm install uri-js

Then, in your code, load it using:

	const URI = require("uri-js");

If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:

	import * as URI from "uri-js";

Or you can load just what you need using named exports:

	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from "uri-js";

## Breaking changes

### Breaking changes from 3.x

URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.

The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.

### Breaking changes from 2.x

URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.

### Breaking changes from 1.x

The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
