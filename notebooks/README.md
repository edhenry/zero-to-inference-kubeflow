# Creating a Notebook Server in Kubeflow

Once [Kubeflow has been deployed](../kubeflow/README.md) we can create a notebook server for testing the model that has been [trained and deployed](../pipeline/README.md).

The process for creating a notebook is relatively straight forward and the UI provided by the Kubeflow dashboard makes the process painless.

See the gif below for a quick overview of creating a notebook server.
